Ask HN: How do you not take criticism of your work personally?

    The pro tip is to attach your self worth not to your skill, but to it's first derivative!

    That way any criticism that helps you improve your game, no matter how unpleasantly delivered, is a power up.

    I say it glibly, like it's easy, but it works if one can internalize it.

    If you do have to reply, don’t do so immediately. Let it marinate and respond when your initial feeling has subsided. That allows you to get some emotional distance between yourself and your work, thus seeing (and fixing) the problem in the thing not yourself. Waiting has the secondary effect that another person may reply in the interim, shifting the burden away.

    When you feel bad, stop to think. Observe your own reaction and calmly try to realise why you’re feeling that way and what’s your goal. The introspection alone can make you see that the situation is unimportant and thus taking it personally is disproportionate.

    Another good approach: Write down that email/ message in a text editor but just leave it there for a day.

Often, I'd realize that I don't want to send it at all. The emotion was processed and now it's fine.

Sometimes, there is a valid point (e.g. because someone was rude in tone) and I'd just give that as feedback in a non-violent manner.

    At some point, I realized that there's a disconnect between "me" and "my work".

    My work is a result of circumstance, like, what my mood was when I did it, how well I know the particular domain, if I've seen solutions to similar problems before, what tools were available and understandable to me at the time.

    In other words, the quality of my work depends much more on what the particular task was, than on some inherent quality within myself.

    So, try not to let it influence me either way, to not feel some unjustified pride that I made something "difficult", or shame that I couldn't manage to do something "easy".

    One liberating tactic I employ, is that I clearly announce when I've messed up, and I'll be the first to do it, and usually with a joke.. "Yeah, so that amazing queue we got up and running last week, I took the liberty to totally mess that up, I learned a lot about how not to do it, I'll eventually learn how to do it right, no worries, I'm working on it." This takes the pressure off, people know it's broken, who broke it, and who's fixing it, and they expect that I come for help if I need it. One thing I don't do, is say sorry, I'm not sorry, this is my job, we do software development, we break stuff, we make errors, and I'm not sorry about it.

    In art school, we spent a lot of time learning how to give and receive critiques, because the fastest way to improve was to try frequently and critique often.

    You learn very early to divorce your ego and sense of self from your artworks and embrace every attempt as an opportunity to improve towards an ideal you can never reach.

    You also learn how to give meaningful criticism without being an asshole.

    Writing code is very much the same.

    Unfortunately, most software engineers haven't been to art school and have no formal training in how to give and receive useful feedback.

    I recommend reading Art & Fear: Observations On the Perils (and Rewards) of Artmaking. It's a good book that helps you build a healthy mindset towards growing as a creative:

    me: 
    Guess everything depends on the context, however the context can be misunderstood.

    The best way is to take a break, this makes it easier to evaluate the information in it's proper context.
