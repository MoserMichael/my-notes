Writing it down, so as not to get confused.

Intro

the zen of all coding conventions: name your functions/types/variables as they do in the standard library - one needs to avoid having more than one naming convention in the code, so take that of the stdlib :-)

also that's another reason to use an IDE like IntelliJ - they give you better hints than vim... :-( 


Summary of coding conventions

Python
------
    Prescribed by PEP8  - https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/

    Prefers spaces (tabstop four spaces)
    class names: CamelCase
    function names, variable names: lower_case_with_underscore
    constants: ALL_CAPITAL_WITH_UNDERSCORE
    (private functions variables start with underscore)

Golang
------
    See: https://go.dev/doc/effective_go#names 

    No Tabs for indenatation!!! (they are religious about that...)
    package names: single-word, lower case 
    MixedCase rules - for functions and structure names (first capital letter for names exported from package)
    Interface names: Writer, Notifier (-er suffix)
    Don't use underscore for function/class names - they prefer mixedCaseNames for everything! (don't forget that!)
    Braces: c-like braces (because the compiler inserts ; by some implicit rules)
    Remember: exported symbols must have a capital letter as first letter (OMG)

Java
----    
    See: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/codeconventions-namingconventions.html

    Package names: all lower case
    class names: should be nouns, MixedCase
    interface names: also MixedCase (no requirement for nouns)
    function variable names: firstCharLowerWithMixedCase
    constants: UPPER_CASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES

Rust
----
    See: https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.0.0/style/style/naming/README.html

    Types: CamelCase
    function parameters variables: snake_case

C++ (google style guide)
------------------------

    See: https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html

    Type names: CamelCase
    function variable names: with_underscore
    Class members variables: have_trailing_underscore_
    struct members: dont_have_trailing_underscore
    constant names, enumeration constants: kMixedCase (must have prefix k)

PHP
---
    See: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/php/php-src/master/CODING_STANDARDS.md

    function names: with_underscores
    Module exported functions: should have a prefix with the name of the module (why? Even with the addition of namespaces?)
    class names: CamelCase
    iterator or exception: - with suffix Iterator and Exception, respectively
    Braces: K&R style, Use tabs for identation, also Tab==4 spaces
        if (.. ) {
          echo "blabla";
        }
