This is a log, here I am listing the gotchas that I stepped upon as a developer.
Maybe someone will find this to be of any use, at least it is useful to me, so as not to step onto the same rake twice.
(should have started a log like this ages ago ...)

show dependecies with gradle

    cd <directory of sub project>

    gradle -q dependencies

On the github page: a comment with /retest will cause the CI to rerun the build and test. (/rebuild doesn't work).
Â§This may be a feature of the particular CI scripts that we are using, don't know.

gradle, oh gradle.

gradle cleanTest  test --fail-fast 2>&1 | tee log.log


- without cleanTest it will not rerun the tests after a successful run (why?)
- --fail-fast tell it to stop on the first test failure (much easier to debug the tests this way).\

I have the following function in my .bashrc file (and it's always better to keep a log of that compilation/test run)


function makeIt {
    if [[ -f build.gradle ]]; then
        cmd=$1
        if [[ $cmd == "" ]]; then
            gradle cleanTest  test --fail-fast 2>&1 | tee log.log
            #gradle cleanTest build  2>&1 | tee log.log
        else
            gradle "$@" 2>&1 | tee log.log
        fi
    else
        if [[ -f pom.xml ]]; then
            cmd=$1
            if [[ $cmd == "" ]]; then
                mvn compile 2>&1 | tee log.log
            else
                mvn "$@" 2>&1 | tee log.log
            fi
        else
            if [[ -f Makefile  ]] || [[ -f makefile ]] || [[ -f GNUmakefile ]]; then
                make "$@" 2>&1 | tee log.log
            else
                echo "don't know how to make this, yet"
            fi
        fi
    fi
}

alias m='makeIt'

java will start to omit stack traces, without this option. -XX:-OmitStackTraceInFastThrow

Why did they do that? Why?
