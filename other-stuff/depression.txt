- very important how one is interpreting things (attributional or explanatory style)

    https://positivepsychology.com/explanatory-styles-optimism/#theory

    Attribution theory - "our tendency to offer similar explanations for different events.” or "the way in which you explain your circumstances to yourself."

    "Heider (1958, as cited in Malle, 2011) initially distinguished between perceived internal and external causes for events. Subsequently, attributional theorist, Weiner (1972) drew a distinction between (temporally) stable versus unstable causes, with stable attributions for failure being seen to contribute towards poor or low levels of motivation. The third dimension of helplessness was first introduced by Kelley (1972) who focussed on ascriptions of global versus specific causes for adverse events."

    "The concept of explanatory style with three parameters (internality, stability, and globality) and the inclusion of a proposed distinction between optimistic and pessimistic attributional styles was hypothesized by Abramson, Semmel, Seligman, & Von Baeyer (1978)."

    "Explanatory style as we know it was born primarily from two antecedents: The Learned Helplessness Model and The Reformulation of the Learned Helplessness Model."

        "Learned helplessness proposes that control over the environment is a fundamental precursor of positivism for any organism. If an individual is repeatedly exposed to unavoidable painful or otherwise negative stimuli, they will come to expect that such events are uncontrollable and potentially develop a sense of hopelessness and depression as a result (Overmier & Seligman, 1967)."

        "The research suggested that helplessness is a learned behavior. When placed in a situation where there is no control over the outcome, the animals were conditioned to expect that future attempts to negate the shocks would be futile and therefore gave up trying. Hiroto & Seligman (1975) hypothesized that humans, like animals, would cease attempts to change their circumstances if it was deemed to be out of their control.."

        "experiences with uncontrollable events led to difficulties in motivation, cognition, and emotion."

    reformulated learned helplessness

        "The reformulated model included three causal explanatory dimensions of attribution; stable/unstable causes, internal/external causal statements, and global/specific causal explanations (Abramson et al., 1978) which we will look at in more detail later."

        "the specific ways in which individuals cope with and explain uncontrollable events, Abramson et al., (1978) posited that people develop a characteristic causal explanation for unpredictable life events. This predisposing explanatory set was later termed “explanatory style” by Peterson and Seligman (1984)."

            "A pessimistic explanatory style is characterized by explanations of the causes of negative outcomes as being stable, global, and internal, and the causes of positive outcomes as being unstable, specific and external in nature." ... " They personally blame themselves for bad events and perceive the root cause to be a fixed factor. When something good happens, they tend to attribute it to luck and see the cause as temporary. " - that bad thing is that this creates a cycle of helplessness.

            Additional dimensions (Psychologist use tests to measure these aspects)
                
                - internal (me) or external ('the circumstances') are used to explain success vs failure? 
                - permanence of forecast?
                - global vs specific - 

            "Conversely, optimistic explanatory styles are characterized by explanations for negative outcomes as being due to unstable, specific and external causes, while positive outcomes are perceived as due to stable, global and internal causes."


- many risk factors for depression (having depressed parents is a strong factor - so I am doing damage to my kids when feeling down !!!)

- many paths into depression, many paths out - each person has a different story to tell...

- important: develop skills how to get out of depression. (medication does not train these - therefore high relapse ratio)
    - better explanatory style 
    - better interpersonal skills / come up with a support network
    - problem solving / decision making skills
    - HOW TO BUILD A COMPELLING FUTURE

- people who focus on the future 'how do I build my future' do better at getting out of depression !!!

- key risk factors:
    - internal orientation :: use themselves as reference point, use their feeling to interpret reality, indication on what to do. This drives you inwardly.
            Your feelings can easily deceive you. Ability to go outside of your own self - to compare things - is important.
            Goal: learn to 'reality test', this requires to 'go out of yourself' - to overcome 'cognitive rigidity'. 
            Otherwise you are a prisoner of your own thoughts.
     
            Cognitive flexibility is important: create multiple explanations on what is happening. (prevents your from overgeneralizing an driving yourself mad, believing your own explanation of things)
            Master the art of recognizing what you don't know

     - stress generation : how do people make decisions that make their depression worse? 

         How do moods influence decision making processes? Your mood influences what you remember and how you make choices.

         Learn how to take actions that are consistent with the goals rather than take actions that are consistent with the feelings !!!

         Stop drinking - alcohol is aggravating depression!!!

     - wrong: using the past a reference point to predict the future - that's a bad loop!
       Need to convert things into action

         "was never good, will never be good"

         IMPORTANT MESSAGE: YOU ARE MORE THAN YOUR HISTORY!!! DON'T USE IRRELEVANT STUFF TO DEFINE YOUR OWN SELF!

         CREATE POSSIBILITIES, THERE AREN'T ANY GUARANTEES FOR .. FOREVER.

         Getting out of the loop in your thoughts: use your thoughts to plan/create useful / positive, timely action - instead of moving in circles.

     - Global cognitive style: person engages in over-general thinking. 

         Example: have a bad day - life isn't fair (jumping from day to life)

         This prevents you from solving problems effectively, prevents you from learning skills - if you always tend to overgeneralize.

         Flow of steps: that's an exercise to go from "global" to "concrete" in their thinking.
            - delineate all the steps it needs to do a given task (like doing a shower)
         Next exercise : "do a flowchart for being happy". 
            - being specific is something that depressed persons have a hard time with.
     
     - our expectations are the filter for how we make judgements; now how do you know if your expectations are realistic?

         Unrealistic expectations are a source of unhappiness.
         
         First check: is that realistic? (??)
      
- When you need professional help?
    - suicidal thoughts (big indication)
    - feeling stuck, overwhelmed
    - don't have help by support network that can help with 'reality testing'

- Importance of getting help
    - you are blind for your own blind spots (that's the purpose of this talks)
    - need to do big decisions, depression affects quality of decisions
    - a depressed person is dragging down three other persons on average.
 
- Todo list: 
    
    - physical examinations (to exclude health factors that could make it worse)
    - Alcohol - complete stop
    - get enough sleep (number one common complaint!)
    - exercise!!! (quick gains)
    - do fun thing - you need to get out of the rut,
    - don't compare yourself to others / stay clear of social media.

    = learn about your psychological vulnerabilities (first step in coping with them)
    = learn to distinguish 
        = facts from feelings/beliefs from facts

And other stuff....

    Closure counts for lot - don't leave things unresolved, move on.
