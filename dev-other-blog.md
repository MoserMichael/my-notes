Just realized: ChatGTP isn't hallucinating, these are Androids who are dreaming of electric sheep!

Now I am re-reading "Do Androids dream of electric sheep" by Philip K Dick, so writing down the memorable phrases/scenes. [more...](androids-electric-sheep.txt)

/actually pasting out memorable phrases is a nice trick - for staying focused on the text, while you have half a hundred tab windows open in the web browser.../

[Stack Overflow is ChatGPT Casualty: Traffic Down 14% in March](https://www.similarweb.com/blog/insights/ai-news/stack-overflow-chatgpt/)

So where the stack overflow posts ... training their own replacement?
But if any harm comes to SO then the quality of the tech answers in ChatGTP will also be affected.

As Berthold Brecht said "So many reports. So many questions."  [Questions of a reading worker](https://www.emag-augsburg.de/2018/02/21/questions-of-a-reading-worker/)

I have summed up an interesting interview with Erica Franz on Authoritarian regimes [link to my summary](political-stuff.txt) - with specific reference to Putins attempts to resurrect Stalinism.

In Soviet school they used to teach us that Lenin was writing summaries of the stuff that he read [here](https://prorivists.org/how_lenin_worked_with_a_book/) - so they forced us to do likewise... Somehow i have come to think that this is a good practice (of course Lenin's regime was a very nasty one...)

me talking with ChatGTP on classical AI and the attempts to combine classical AI with ML
[link to the talk](talking-with-chatgtp.md)

I have come to think that ChatGTP is very good at this kind of general discussions.

(also I appreciate the lack of hubris on the part of ChatGTP - very unlike all the real workers in the field. ChatGTP is also always there to explain these frequent acronyms and explains what it is referring to - you just have to ask...)

/later discovered that Google Bard is better at it - because it has a later knowledge cutoff date than ChatGTP3.5 ; this means that the data used to train Google Bard is newer and more up to date than that of ChatGTP3.5/
