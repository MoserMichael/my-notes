In Soviet school they used to teach us that Lenin was writing summaries of the stuff that he read [here](https://prorivists.org/how_lenin_worked_with_a_book/) - so they forced us to do likewise... Somehow i have come to think that this is a good practice.

me talking with ChatGTP on classical AI and the attempts to combine classical AI with ML
[link to the talk](talking-with-chatgtp.md)

I have come to think that ChatGTP is very good at this kind of general discussions.
