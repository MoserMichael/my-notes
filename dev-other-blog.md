### My blog for stuff that i used to post on twitter

... so no i am putting my observations over here, instead of posting them on social media (kind of)

Today i learned, that the concept of a UNIX daemon is derived from the ancient Greek concept of daemon/daimon - that's just some kind of spirit, it's not an evil demon - a very different beast! (always these subtle differences..)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daemon_(computing%29

'In the general sense, daemon is an older form of the word "demon", from the Greek δαίμων. In the Unix System Administration Handbook Evi Nemeth states the following about daemons:[3]
Many people equate the word "daemon" with the word "demon", implying some kind of satanic connection between UNIX and the underworld. This is an egregious misunderstanding. "Daemon" is actually a much older form of "demon"; daemons have no particular bias towards good or evil, but rather serve to help define a person's character or personality. The ancient Greeks' concept of a "personal daemon" was similar to the modern concept of a "guardian angel"—eudaemonia is the state of being helped or protected by a kindly spirit. As a rule, UNIX systems seem to be infested with both daemons and demons'

Is LLM [prompt engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prompt_engineering) is the art of asking a questions to the language model, one that is likely to produce a better result. 
The idea looks similar to  ... [Robopsychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robopsychology) in 'I Robot' by Asimov

We are living in an interesting time...

A different view would be, that it's just a way to optimize the results of a search engine.

Just realized: ChatGTP isn't hallucinating, these are Androids who are dreaming of electric sheep!

Now I am re-reading "Do Androids dream of electric sheep" by Philip K Dick, so writing down the memorable phrases/scenes. [more...](androids-electric-sheep.txt)

/actually pasting out memorable phrases is a nice trick - for staying focused on the text, while you have half a hundred tab windows open in the web browser...
The good part is that this method can help with last point in the text (it's like a bookmark) - just search for the last phrase that got copied in the notes/

... And the Androids in the book also do have hallucinations! "Maybe that's a false memory. Don't androids sometimes go around with false memories?"

[Stack Overflow is ChatGPT Casualty: Traffic Down 14% in March](https://www.similarweb.com/blog/insights/ai-news/stack-overflow-chatgpt/)

So where the stack overflow posts ... training their own replacement?
But if any harm comes to SO then the quality of the tech answers in ChatGTP will also be affected.

As Berthold Brecht said "So many reports. So many questions."  [Questions of a reading worker](https://www.emag-augsburg.de/2018/02/21/questions-of-a-reading-worker/)

Submitted the link to HN [discussion on HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35857536)

I have summed up an interesting interview with Erica Franz on Authoritarian regimes [link to my summary](political-stuff.txt) - with specific reference to Putins attempts to resurrect Stalinism.

In Soviet school they used to teach us that Lenin was writing summaries of the stuff that he read [here](https://prorivists.org/how_lenin_worked_with_a_book/) - so they forced us to do likewise... Somehow i have come to think that this is a good practice (of course Lenin's regime was a very nasty one...)

me talking with ChatGTP on classical AI and the attempts to combine classical AI with ML
[link to the talk](talking-with-chatgtp.md)

I have come to think that ChatGTP is very good at this kind of general discussions.

(also I appreciate the lack of hubris on the part of ChatGTP - very unlike all the real workers in the field. ChatGTP is also always there to explain these frequent acronyms and explains what it is referring to - you just have to ask...)

/later discovered that Google Bard is better at it - because it has a later knowledge cutoff date than ChatGTP3.5 ; this means that the data used to train Google Bard is newer and more up to date than that of ChatGTP3.5/
