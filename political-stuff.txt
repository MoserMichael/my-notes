Erica Frantz - Authoritarian regimes compared (wrote books on the subject of authoritarian and personalist regimes: https://www.amazon.com/Books-Erica-Frantz/s?rh=n%3A283155%2Cp_27%3AErica+Frantz )

Features of a dictatorship:
    - is there a ruling party?
        - does it have a strong organizational basis?
    - secret services
        - subordinate to the big leader?
        - subordinate to the government?
    - secret service vs the army? (is there a structure that can limit the power of the state?)

Analyses authoritarian regimes after WW2
    - change: after the nineties most of them have election!
        why? 
          - more access to foreign aid/foreign relations are more important due to globalization
            - fewer coups/putsches - for fear of loosing foreign backing
          - elections (even sham elections) have a use!
            - increase legitimacy of the regime
            - a form of internal mobilization
                - people get some kickbacks from the rules (Mubarak used to feed his people more during election years (sad))
            - regime with elections stays longer in power!
                - you figure out who of your own cronies is more efficient / better at getting votes (election as a system test)
                - added feedback: you get an idea what the opposition is talking about
          - 'there is a consensus that democracy is the best form of government' ?
    
    Does the internet have an affect? 
        - in theory the opposition can easier mobilize a protest via the net
        - however the regime seems to be in charge: 
            - can use IT as an instrument of repression (these regimes that can seem to be very stable)
                - one thing: protest are less efficient in these states
            - IT can increase efficiency of repression: pinpoint the leaders/easier to identify threats/etc/    
            - it is cheaper to yield digital repressions! (zifrovoy gulag)


    Q: since the nineties: most dictatorship have a leader / are of personal nature. (before that most were ruled by a committee)
        
        - says the effect of the cold war:
            - the US supported military dictators in south America - as a counterweight to Soviet influence
              after the cold war these rulers lost support - and couldn't get any foreign aid (so they were out)
            - fewer party ruled states (the Soviet union - their role model - was no longer)

        - nowadays they have dictatorships 
            - run by one ruler
            - with a supporting party (that doesn't have a say), 
            - ruler in control of the secret service
            - ruler in control of paramilitary organizations 

        - other factors:
            - did the ruler come to power due to elections? He needs a strong party for that - says it's more likely that democratic institutes will be scrapped
            - however a strong party is also a limiting factor! (has some independence and restrain the leader!)

            - military dictatorships: 
                - if a high ranking commander made a coup he will rule by committee/council - this makes transition to democracy easier
                - if it was a low ranking commander then they have a dictator (as he has to cut subordination to his former commanders!)


    General observation:
        
        - authoritarian rulers consolidate their power
            - they remove everyone who could constraint their power
            - then they end up absolutely alone at the top - as they got rid of all their former friends
            - therefore they can't trust anyone and grow increasingly paranoid of conspiracies
                - all sources of info turn into an echo chamber - yes men tell him what he wants to hear

            - she says consolidation of power comes with a loss of a 'certainty about the future'
              it leads to a lot of stress for the dictator (and all, for what?) 
              says this paranoid state is somewhat inevitable - from the course of action they need to take to stay in power...

    Q: why do they loose power? Does the regime stay when the maximum leader is out?

        - says since 1946 - half of the cases the regime survives it's maximum leader!

        - a military Hunta isn't long lasting 
            - the generals make a deal with the new power and return to command the army (they have some place to go after loss of political power)
            - very important deal: they won't go if they will be charged with crimes and have to face court
        
        - party autocracies are long lasting (can find someone to replace maximum leader from within a strong party)

        - personalist dictatorships are least likely to transform into democracy:
            - the regime and the ruler are synonymous
            - loss of leader leads to fall of regime - with a high likelihood - as it is hard to find a replacement leader that fits all interest groups!
            - personalist dictators are also very unlikely to go on their own
                - when getting rid of their competition they get lots of enemies and fear that they will be charged with crimes
                - regime change often comes with mass revolts/civil wars - not good for transition to democracy


        - how do personalist dictators loose powers?
            - can happen in the first few years, when their power has not been solidified
            - after twenty years ... the most frequent cause is the death of the dictator.
              (a coup d'etat is not likely - never happened after the end of the cold war!)
            - most common: the old elites band together and stay on the same course - when the dictator dies.  

    Q: mechanisms of regime change
        - twenty years ago it was always the elites
        - now a series of regime change through mass demonstration happened, but these are less frequent now (she says)
            - opposition groups don't have the same power now (it used to be harder to mobilize people for demos, now it is easier - through social networks) (?)

    Q: wars and authoritarian regimes

        - only 7% of them loose powers throughout wars (started by themselves)
          Says they get ousted during the first year of a war, later period it is much less likely (while the war is going on - the war helps the dictator!)
        - after the war ends: if the dictator looses then that's bad for him (higher chances of being ousted)


    Q: on the Russian - Ukrainian war
        - Putin is very invested in the war, and may go on for a long time.
        - even his successor will likely continue the war... (?) because of regime continuity.
          (they new rulers are afraid to wreck their boat)
