Erica Frantz - Authoritarian regimes compared (wrote books on the subject of authoritarian and personalist regimes: https://www.amazon.com/Books-Erica-Frantz/s?rh=n%3A283155%2Cp_27%3AErica+Frantz )

Features of a dictatorship:
    - is there a ruling party?
        - does it have a strong organizational basis?
    - secret services
        - subordinate to the big leader?
        - subordinate to the government?
    - secret service vs the army? (is there a structure that can limit the power of the state?)

Analyses authoritarian regimes after WW2
    - change: after the nineties most of them have election!
        why? 
          - more access to foreign aid/foreign relations are more important due to globalization
            - fewer coups/putsches - for fear of loosing foreign backing
          - elections (even sham elections) have a use!
            - increase legitimacy of the regime
            - a form of internal mobilization
                - people get some kickbacks from the rules (Mubarak used to feed his people more during election years (sad))
            - regime with elections stays longer in power!
                - you figure out who of your own cronies is more efficient / better at getting votes (election as a system test)
                - added feedback: you get an idea what the opposition is talking about
          - 'there is a consensus that democracy is the best form of government' ?
    
    Does the internet have an affect? 
        - in theory the opposition can easier mobilize a protest via the net
        - however the regime seems to be in charge: 
            - can use IT as an instrument of repression (these regimes that can seem to be very stable)
                - one thing: protest are less efficient in these states
            - IT can increase efficiency of repression: pinpoint the leaders/easier to identify threats/etc/    
            - it is cheaper to yield digital repressions! (zifrovoy gulag)


    Q: since the nineties: most dictatorship have a leader / are of personal nature. (before that most were ruled by a committee)
        
        - says the effect of the cold war:
            - the US supported military dictators in south America - as a counterweight to Soviet influence
              after the cold war these rulers lost support - and couldn't get any foreign aid (so they were out)
            - fewer party ruled states (the Soviet union - their role model - was no longer)

        - nowadays they have dictatorships 
            - run by one ruler
            - with a supporting party (that doesn't have a say), 
            - ruler in control of the secret service
            - ruler in control of paramilitary organizations 

        - other factors:
            - did the ruler come to power due to elections? He needs a strong party for that - says it's more likely that democratic institutes will be scrapped
            - however a strong party is also a limiting factor! (has some independence and restrain the leader!)

            - military dictatorships: 
                - if a high ranking commander made a coup he will rule by committee/council - this makes transition to democracy easier
                - if it was a low ranking commander then they have a dictator (as he has to cut subordination to his former commanders!)


    General observation:
        
        - authoritarian rulers consolidate their power
            - they remove everyone who could constraint their power
            - then they end up absolutely alone at the top - as they got rid of all their former friends
            - therefore they can't trust anyone and grow increasingly paranoid of conspiracies
                - all sources of info turn into an echo chamber - yes men tell him what he wants to hear

            - she says consolidation of power comes with a loss of a 'certainty about the future'
              it leads to a lot of stress for the dictator (and all, for what?) 
              says this paranoid state is somewhat inevitable - from the course of action they need to take to stay in power...

    Q: why do they loose power? Does the regime stay when the maximum leader is out?

        - says since 1946 - half of the cases the regime survives it's maximum leader!

        - a military Hunta isn't long lasting 
            - the generals make a deal with the new power and return to command the army (they have some place to go after loss of political power)
            - very important deal: they won't go if they will be charged with crimes and have to face court
        
        - party autocracies are long lasting (can find someone to replace maximum leader from within a strong party)

        - personalist dictatorships are least likely to transform into democracy:
            - the regime and the ruler are synonymous
            - loss of leader leads to fall of regime - with a high likelihood - as it is hard to find a replacement leader that fits all interest groups!
            - personalist dictators are also very unlikely to go on their own
                - when getting rid of their competition they get lots of enemies and fear that they will be charged with crimes
                - regime change often comes with mass revolts/civil wars - not good for transition to democracy


        - how do personalist dictators loose powers?
            - can happen in the first few years, when their power has not been solidified
            - after twenty years ... the most frequent cause is the death of the dictator.
              (a coup d'etat is not likely - never happened after the end of the cold war!)
            - most common: the old elites band together and stay on the same course - when the dictator dies.  

    Q: mechanisms of regime change
        - twenty years ago it was always the elites
        - now a series of regime change through mass demonstration happened, but these are less frequent now (she says)
            - opposition groups don't have the same power now (it used to be harder to mobilize people for demos, now it is easier - through social networks) (?)

    Q: wars and authoritarian regimes

        - only 7% of them loose powers throughout wars (started by themselves)
          Says they get ousted during the first year of a war, later period it is much less likely (while the war is going on - the war helps the dictator!)
        - after the war ends: if the dictator looses then that's bad for him (higher chances of being ousted)


    Q: on the Russian - Ukrainian war
        - Putin is very invested in the war, and may go on for a long time.
        - even his successor will likely continue the war... (?) because of regime continuity.
          (they new rulers are afraid to wreck their boat)

Other insights:

Ekaterina Shulman is sometimes telling interesting things:

    https://youtu.be/rvQQVGDhI1s?t=465

        - mass mobilisation was a big shock for the system. lots of indications:
            - Mayor of Moscow told on his own accord that "mobilization has finished" - that's not his line of duty
            - others say that they only mobilized half of the target numbers - in Moscow
            - lots of adjustment after that: (the unified database, electronic systems) - these are supposed to fix shortcomings of the mobilization process
            - they try to avoid a repetition of the mobilisation with lots of means:
                - lots of money put into luring people to fight for hire
            - mass emigration was also a shock for the system     

        - measuring support for the war?
            - doubting many of the polls. (high rate of refusing to participate - about 90% !!!)
                (other interview: says she is trusting polls where they ask 'how do other people around you respond to the situation', this question is less likely to form an answer)
            - says there are lots of parameters 
                - age: more support with the older ones
                - men support it more than women (?)
                - rich ones support it more than older ones
                - the bureaucracy does support it more.
                - urban dwellers like it less

            - main point of contention about the war:   
                - why does it take so long?
                - need to get to some result.
                
                These two sentiments don't contradict; people expect the bosses to solve this, as all of the power on foreign policy issues were put into their hands.
                (army used to have highest level of public trust)    

         - are elections of 2024 an issue? 
            - says the system want's to remain without much change, elections are important, as elections are a
                - renewal of legitimacy
                - system test for the bureaucracy
                - What comes after the election? Will the population challenge the results? (that's an important issue).
            - says they won't stress the issue of the war during the election - they won't put a stress on the issue...

        
        - what about Prigozhin? What will be his role?
            - says that's a new item! System is very etatist, bureacracy has a big/defining role.
            - very surpising move to use mobilize prisoners / with promise of granting a pardon. (says the whole system got broken!)
            - says they will get rid of Prigozhin - he isn't part of the hierarchic bureacracy, says Prigozhin is a destabilizing element.
            - will they succeed to get rid of him?
                - yes, if the system doesn't break down.
                - prigozhin is an agent of chaos.

            - what about the army? The system tries to keep influence of Army in bounds.
                - maybe they use Prigozhin as a tool to keep the influence of the Army in bounds? In that case he will go on for a while.
                     
        - is the governing elite support Putin in the same way? support going up or down?
             - hard to measure. says there are indirect ways:
             - from last years - summer, she sees two needs: (some want to gain from the 'new order of things' some want to get back to normal)

                - need for normalization (from the civil society elites)
                - mobilization economy: some are interested to keep it, and maintain it! 
                    - says those who benefit from the war want to keep it up :-( (not just the secret services)
                    - they hope for confiscations from the previous oligarchs (to get the loot)

              - mr putin needs to balance between these two (and both see him as their opportunity and as a liability)
                also ge doesn't quite like the 'war economy thing' - sees that as a threat to his order / status quo....
              - two factions are in conflict since last fall - when the war turned into a prolonged campaign.

        - speaking about Lukashenko's health problems: 
            personalist systems - the autocrat sticks to power till the end (for fear of retributions)
            Now if he dies in office then that increases the chances of getting the same system with a new leader
            Still there can be changes in the system after the transition of power.... (see Soviet Union post 1953, Uzbekistan)
