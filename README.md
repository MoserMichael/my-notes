# my-notes
Keeping notes while learning stuff (so they don't get lost) These notes are best viewed in vim ;)

Writing down notes while reading something helps me with the learning 
* it forces me to to sum it up into a more concise form by formulating the main points into a concise format.
* Keeping notes allows to look through the stuff when i actually need it.
