# my-notes

Keeping notes while learning stuff (so they don't get lost) 

These notes are best viewed in vim, where I wrote them - the intention is that it should be viewed in fixed font with the text wrapping on.
(one option would be to do markdown; the problem is that it is often non-trivial to convert to markdown as symbols like underscore have special meaning in markdown)

Writing down notes while reading something helps me with the learning 
* it forces me to to sum it up into a more concise form by formulating the main points into a concise format.
* Keeping notes allows to look through the stuff when i actually need it.

maybe learning is just a process that sums up information into a more concise format (learning might be a kind of lossy compression designed to adjust information for a limited human memory and limited attention span)
