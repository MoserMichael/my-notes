Interesting book...

===
me ranting: 

The books talks quite a lot about Rousseau, the father of the political left - and that it came out of admiration of indigenous socieities...
(Turgot called it bullshit - for exactly the right reasons!!!)

    Anne Robert Jacques Turgot - he was also 'finance minister'(controller general of finance) for Louis-XVI and almost saved the monarchy
    (was a big laissez-fair economist, did lots of reforms, was against supporting the USA, as it was too expensive)

    https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/10/16/the-first-free-market-reform-00061230#:~:text=On%20May%2012%2C%201776%2C%20Louis,Turgot%20was%20a%20visionary.

    Turgot was a big laissez-faire economist (like Adam Smith). 

    Was intendant of Limoges region, lots of reforms that were successful
    Louis XVI appointed him finance minister (royal intendant).
    Now he liberalized grain trade - this had a big effect...
        
    "In times of poor harvest, the crown capped grain prices, kept emergency stores and facilitated grain distribution. Additionally, a number of powerful players — including the king’s brothers — made a fortune on tolls and various grain taxes. Turgot’s Letters on the Liberty of the Grain Trade (1770) was based on the simple equation that if the crown removed its caps, guarantees, protections and other tolls, the grain trade would prosper and the market would expand, thus bringing more profits to farmers and lower prices to consumers."

    Now the system of bread subsidies and grain stores/emergency was disrupted, 1776 - as a result of this liberalization.

    bad harvest ... famine, riots. They say the riots bred a movement of opposition that resulted in the revolution.

    /still they mention grain imports from Poland - in passing.../

    (may be a bit one sided - as they are pushing their argument against neo-liberalism - politico/

    /interesting that wikipedia didn't mention that... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Robert_Jacques_Turgot /
    

The authors ideal social structure seems to be some kind of anarchism.
Now I don't know about anarchism, but had some experience with state socialism:
the problem with socialism:

- tragedy of the commongs: everyone tries to increase his private gain by steeling from the shared property - which turns into 'no-ones property'.
- kills initiative and then excludes/sidelines those whoe have initiative
- see any change of the status quo as threat. feels threatened by change.
- does not invest in the future, prefers short term gains over long term investment (due to first point).
- the state bureacracy is not got at running an economy. It can be good at mobilizing everything into one task (like winning a war). Problems: state machinery is riddled with internal conflicts of interest and not stellar at information processing.
- the stuff is declared to belong to everyone, so no-one cares. 
- What Marx calls: alienation/entfremdung (it is a big thing in state socialism)

(in one word Pofigizm...)

end of me ranting:

How did socialism get popular among younger people in America? (see it on reddit)
Looks like it has something to do with student loans, fewer employment opportunities, etc. perceived 'greed' of the system.

----------------
The book:

Where do we come from?

    Rousseau 'Discourse on the Origin and the Foundation of Inequality Among Mankind' - initial state: small bands of hunter gathereres living in harmony and equality (everyone being poor) - until the invention of agriculture (here comes private property on land that needs to be protected) and cities (money, debt, state, bueraucracies, economic specialization), later: Fukuyama,Diamond - hierarchies form with more complex organization forms (bands -> tribes -> chiefdoms -> kingdoms). (contemprary Rousseau fans study: Hadza, Pygmies or !Kung)
Then comes the surplus and all sorts of people start to appropriate and live on it: priests, warriors ... scholars: they band togather to defend their interests/assets: here we have a state.    

Hobbes Leviathan - initial state: everyone is fighting everyone else. 'Hierarchy and domination, and cynical self-interest, have always been the basis of human society. ' It needs a repressive machine to civilize us. Pinker: along these lines - we never had it so good, early humans were brutish and life was short (lots of cherrypicking: Romito2 burial has corpses with genetic defects, these people had to be cared for by the community) Contemprary Hobbes fans study: Yanomami in the amazon (because early ethonographer painted them as especially fierce, because they gain advantage in their society by killing other men - but the discussion around that got very heated)

    Authors say the intial state is more varied, lots of experiments 'Agriculture, in turn, did not mean the inception of private property, nor did it mark an irreversible step towards inequality. In fact, many of the first farming communities were relatively free of ranks and hierarchies'. 

    Says we also need to consider different voices, not just european scholars, also other archaologiceal findings than what we got used to.

    Says he doesn't like both of them: both implies that current state can't be changed, because it is 'determined by the nature of things', current state becomes inevitable as 'you can't go back to tribal formation'
    Also: there must have been some experimentation in the field of social organization - people were living for a damn long time, tens of thousands of years until 3000BC. The idea that there were and are alternatives - that's what he aims for...

Problems: Enlightenment thinkers who propounded ideals of freedom/equality/democracy almost invariably put them in the mouths of foreigners, even ‘savages’. This is hardly surprising, since it’s almost impossible to find a single author in that Western tradition, from Plato to Marcus Aurelius to Erasmus, who did not make it clear that they would have been opposed to such ideas ... until the 19th century these ideas didn't gain ground in Europe! (taking these ideas as exclusively European is also whitewashing collonialism - as Europe brought them the light, 'white mans burden')

Quotes Benjamin Franklin: he says most persons who had the choice between living with the natives and in the 'west' were choosing ... to stay with the natives.

Early evidence of previous objects traveling long distances: this can have many interpretations (not just market economy)
    - Iroquean do long quests to satisfy some dream/vision. (vision quests)
    - traveling healers/entertaieners - their rewards can travel a long way.
    - gambling: women like to gamble on some exotic stuff

Says the narrative of Hobbes vs Rousseau doesn't leave lots of possibilities - 'Rather than asking how we ended up
unequal, we will start by asking how it was that ‘inequality’ became such an issue to begin with,'

----

Where did Rousseau come from? 

won first price in essay competition of the Academie on 'Has the restoration of the sciences and arts contributed to moral improvement?' Rosseau: 'answered with no, Our elementary moral intuitions, he asserted, are fundamentally decent and sound; civilization merely corrupts by encouraging us to value form over content' ; ' first humans were essentially good, but nonetheless systematically avoided one another for fear of violence'


In 1754 the Academie announced a essay competition on 'what is the origin of inequality among men, and is it authorized by natural law?' - which is rather surprising question, given that France was an extremely hierarchical society. Says that's because the Enlightenment was trigered by the expansion of trades/colonies before that - suddenly Europe got in touch with the world (after having been the backwaters of the world during middle ages)

R. asks "How is it that Europeans are able to turn wealth into power; turn a mere unequal distribution of material goods – which exists, at least to some degree, in any society – into the ability to tell others what to do, to employ them as servants..?" ... answer is inspired by Lahontan or Jesuites. "Rousseau agrees, in essence, with Kandiaronk’s view that civilized Europeans were, by and large, atrocious creatures, for all the reasons that the Wendat had outlined; and he agrees that property is the root of the problem"
also says that Indians are better off than europeans: ‘the Savages of Canada, notwithstanding their Poverty, are richer than you, among whom all sorts of crimes are committed upon the score of Mine and Thine.’ (later: Indians work less and can get more with less effort)

" If we ask, not ‘what are the origins of social inequality?’ but ‘what are the origins of the question about the origins of social inequality?’ (in other words, how did it come about that, in 1754, the Académie de Dijon would think this an appropriate question to ask?), then we are immediately confronted with a long history of Europeans arguing with one another about the nature of faraway societies"

/later: the question is strange: " apart from the implications of primordial innocence, this way of framing the problem suggests a certain diagnosis of what is wrong with society, and what can and can’t be done about it" /

Says there was quite some discussion between native americans and europeans - on a philosophical level!

"For European audiences, the indigenous critique would come as a shock to the system, revealing possibilities for human emancipation that, once disclosed, could hardly be ignored."

claims that the notion of 'equality' was very alien to european philosophy/thinkers, that came from the debate on 'natural law' in 17th cent. Pizarro and Cortez conquered without direct authorization, the 'natural law' debate discussed if that action was legal, the problem is that natives were not heathens, as they didn't know about christian religion, should they be treated as heathens? "The legal and philosophical question then became: what rights do human beings have simply by dint of being human – that is, what rights could they be said to have ‘naturally’, even if they existed in a State of Nature,"

That was the starting point for Hobbes,Locke to elaborate on that starting point: what was the original state of nature?

- says this is the setting where opinions of natives becomes important - as showing some alternative to the european state (assumed to be the only right and eternal truth) 
/this kind of literaure by missionaries and discussions with 'savages' suddenly becomes very important, but philosophers like to ignore any input by non-europeans - it goes against their dogma/

indigineous thinkers criticised the lack of freedom in the European 'way of life', 17th century travel literature ' exposed its readers to this kind of criticism, along with providing a sense of social possibility'

--

Says the notion of 'noble savages' is because men dealt with hunting and fighting  - that's what european aristocrats were doing (women indians were farming)

Miqmaq indians are quoted "‘They consider themselves better than the French: “For,” they say, “you are always fighting and quarrelling among yourselves; we live peaceably. You are envious and are all the time slandering each other; you are thieves and deceivers; you are covetous, and are neither generous nor kind; as for us, if we have a morsel of bread we share it with our neighbour" ... "Mi’kmaq would constantly assert that they were, as a result, ‘richer’ than the French. The French had more material possessions, the Mi’kmaq conceded; but they had other, greater assets: ease, comfort and time." (isn't that what Russian nationalists say about the west?)

"In the considered opinion of the Montagnais-Naskapi, however, the French were little better than slaves, living in constant terror of their superiors."

The Jesuites were trained in classics and were arguign with the Indians, yet 'were impressed by the quality of the counterarguments they had to contend with. How could such rhetorical facility have come to those with no awareness of the works of Varro and Quintilian?'

(me: is it possible that Jesuites weren't exactly big fans of modernity, and were using the indigenous argument against it as their tool against something they did not partiularly like? Sort of like in Zauberberg of Thomas Man!!)

'speakers of Iroquoian languages such as the Wendat, or the five Haudenosaunee nations to their south, who appear to have placed such weight on reasoned debate' where the Chief had to persuade his people, otherwise they don't follow.
'it appears to have been exactly this form of debate – rational, sceptical, empirical, conversational in tone – which before long came to be identified with the European Enlightenment as well.' and both came with rejection of 'arbitrary authority'.

/me: now go and have a society that produces complex tools and products with a egalitarian tribe structure, without money exchange and debt financing, laws, etc.../

book: Lahontan "Curious Dialogues with a Savage of Good Sense Who Has Travelle" 1703 - conversations with native Adario/Kandiaorank of unusual eloquence, the book was quite influential, says these were not made up.
Lahontan tells that natives held their way of life as superior, adds criticism of private property ‘They think it unaccountable that one man should have more than another, and that the rich should have more respect than the poor. In short, they say, the name of savages, which we bestow upon them, would fit ourselves better, since there is nothing in our actions that bears an appearance of wisdom.’ (though earlier the authors say that the fields were property of the Women, and the mens property were his weapons, etc - but  that they shared the harves/spoils of war)
Lahontan quotes Kandiaronk's criticism of western civiliztion 'he perceived failure of European societies to promote mutual aid and protect personal liberties'

- no punitive laws in native societies because there is no money. (so no need to enforce debts/contracts?)
  (well says 'no laws' - but the Wendat had their own law codex, therefore the whole dialoge was held to be forged)
- suggests Europe should adopt the ways of the Wendat, by accepting abstract 'equality'


Is such a deep dialog plausible? Says yes - because of schizmogenesis : defining themselfes as the opposite of the other:

    Says on the one hand Europeans and native americans learned from each other:
    // ? Americans began using European muskets; European settlers began to adopt more indulgent American approaches to disciplining children ?
    But on the other hand each side defined itself as being the opposite of the other (sharpening their differences!)

Influence of this book: lots of other authors wrote critiques of western civilization voiced by 'savage sages'.
". Montesquieu chose a Persian; the Marquis d’Argens a Chinese; Diderot a Tahitian; Chateaubriand a Natchez; Voltaire’s L’Ingénu was half Wendat and half French"
    
'between 1703 and 1751, ... the indigenous American critique of European society had an enormous impact on European thought. What began as widespread expressions of outrage and distaste by Americans (when first exposed to European mores) eventually evolved, ...  into an argument about the nature of authority, decency, social responsibility and, above all, freedom. As it became clear to French observers that most indigenous Americans saw individual autonomy and freedom of action as consummate values – organizing their own lives in such a way as to minimize any possibility of one human being becoming subordinated to the will of another, and hence viewing French society as essentially one of fractious slaves' 
(also: 'In the (native) American view, the freedom of the individual was assumed to be premised on a certain level of ‘baseline communism’, since, after all, people who are starving or lack adequate clothes or shelter in a snowstorm are not really free to do much of anything, other than whatever it takes to stay alive' in contrast: "The European conception of individual freedom was, by contrast, tied ineluctably to notions of private property" ... "In this view, freedom was always defined – at least potentially – as something exercised to the cost of others. What’s more, there was a strong emphasis in ancient Roman (and modern European) law on the self-sufficiency of households; hence, true freedom meant autonomy in the radical sense, not just autonomy of the will, but being in no way dependent on other human beings"

----

POV of the West changes with Turgot in 1751: critique of a book Madame de Graffigny about Incas (this society is not egalitarian at all)
Turgot: equality possible  'is possible in a society where each household is largely self-sufficient and, therefore, where everyone is equally poor' with more complex production trade this equality gets lots. 
'The only alternative, according to him, would be massive, Inca-style state intervention to create a uniformity of social conditions: an enforced equality which could only have the effect of crushing all initiative and, therefore, result in economic and social catastrophe' (!!!)
Says that 'technological progress as (the main) driver for overall social improvement' (!!!)


Later Turgot argued for staged ladder of social evolution: " social evolution, he reasoned, always begins with hunters, then moves on to a stage of pastoralism, then farming, and only then finally passes to the contemporary stage of urban commercial civilization" - meaning that a society is defined by their mode of subsistence. /in a way the first stage to declaring indigenous societies as primitive/

/says the main englightenment view evolve as the direct reaction to the critique by native americans!!!/

Says Rousseau's essays incorporate the indigenous critique of European society (mirror Kandiaronk), critique of private property as the source of inequality and lack of liberty + doctrine of progress = the birth of the left, as an 'intellectual project' (but he is alone in not writing some 'dialogue' - his savages are thought experiments)


... "But we can argue that, in folding together the indigenous critique and the doctrine of progress originally developed to counter it, Rousseau did in fact write the founding document of the left as an intellectual project"

.... 

Rosseau on the origin of inequality: for him the Indians are naive and could not imagine what would come out of the concept of proprty. 'He was just about the only major figure of the French Enlightenment who didn’t write a dialogue or other imaginative work attempting to look at European society from a foreign point of view. In fact, he strips his ‘savages’ of any imaginative powers of their own; their happiness is entirely derived from their inability to imagine things'
that's a kind of 'myth of the stupid savage' .... later 'Nineteenthcentury imperialists adopted the stereotype enthusiastically, merely adding on a variety of ostensibly scientific justifications – from Darwinian evolutionism to ‘scientific’ racism –'


/general observation: they tendedto portray indigenous populations as naive: part of this was the question of leasure. In Victorian times it was assumed that 'things are only getting better' and that modern people have more leasure. The opposite is true! Now if you assume that someone is always busy searching for food then he does not have time for anything else!

The truth is they worked much less then later on. Also planting was just too time-consuming for them "They just didn’t see any reason why they should. ‘Why should we plant,’ one !Kung informant put it – in a phrase cited ever since in a thousand treatises on the origins of farming – ‘when there are so many mongongo nuts in the world?’ ... such foragers had ‘rejected the Neolithic Revolution in order to keep their leisure" ... but that's only some of them, you can't generalize...

What about conservatives? How do they react?

    - in 1859 some guys took over the British Ethnological society and "called for the extermination of inferior people". These guys invented the term 'noble savage' as a ridicule.
    - Gilbert Chinard in 1913: says Rousseau got some ideas from the dialoges with Kandiaorank, also says the Jesuites  "promoted ‘dangerous ideas’ in giving us the impression of the good qualities of ‘savages’"
        (Chinard held Jesuites responsible for entertaining dangerous ideas that inspired Rousseau and therefore 'gave rise to revolutionary spirits')

says the right took to inventing the 'myth of the noble savage' - as a caricature of the left, as an attack on the left.

... long section on why the slogan 'egalite' is ... not defined at all. (equality for who and in what sense?)

===

What about the origin of the human species? We don't know much, there is a lot of guessing. Only tangible thing is anthropology.
Are we just bullying apes (called dominance-submissive behavior)? Now human society has lots of tools to restrain bullying behavior, says Boehm: ridicule, shame, shunning..
Boehm says that this is a choice, kind of "they understand what their society might look like if they did things differently: if, for instance, skilled hunters were not systematically belittled,..."

(Me: in Russian they would say 'ne vysovyvajsja'... guess any collectivist society would have an equivalent for that...)

nice observation: "The solution to the battle between ‘Hobbesian hawks and Rousseauian doves’ turns out to be: our genetic nature is Hobbesian, but our political history is pretty much exactly as described by Rousseau."

===

Still they found ice age burials near Brno and Dordogne (France), with lots of decorations, mamoth teeth, etc. This is not a sign of everyone beeing equal... And no one knows what happened at Göbekli Tepe or Yudinovo - they guess that ‘hunter-gatherer societies had evolved institutions to support major public works, projects, and monumental constructions, and thus had a complex social hierarchy


So maybe we were structural societies all along, and ther was no 'golden egalitarian age' after all?

Still these are sporadic things, they don't see other signs of of stratifications like bigger houses or special storehouses for the elites, etc.

So maybe some bands were highly centralized 'like chimps' and others were egalitarian 'like bonobos' ?
Authors say this comparison is misleading: groups had the social organization because of their own conscious choice! Apparently they had lots of discussions, even before writing.

However: 'over the course of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries it was political self-consciousness that European philosophers came to see as some kind of amazing historical achievement: as a phenomenon which only really became possible with the Enlightenment itself, and the subsequent American and French Revolutions' in contrast to that 'Like many North American peoples of his time, Kandiaronk’s Wendat nation saw their society as a confederation created by conscious agreement; agreements open to continual renegotiation.'

However Rousseau and his band regarded them all as primitive, incapable of political thought with a 'pre-logical mentality'.

says real anthropologists don't regard native people as primitive.

also: indigineous societies tolerate excentricity, because they don't have institutionalized coercion.
So among these excentrics they have prophets, priests, bulls (operator types), leaders - argues that there must have been quite some level of experementation in the social field...

Levi strauss: antropologist who came up with the idea that indigenous people are just like people in modern societies:
studied the Nambikwara tribe in Brazil, observed that their chiefs were just the same as modern politicians.
"they resembled modern politicians operating tiny embryonic welfare states, pooling resources and doling them out to those in need. What impressed Lévi-Strauss above all was their political maturity. It was the chiefs’ skill in directing small bands of dry-season foragers, of making snap decisions in crises (crossing a river, directing a hunt) that later qualified them to play the role of mediators and diplomats in the village plaza." 

(later: "their houses might have resembled social service dispensaries in modern welfare states; but as a result, in terms of material wealth, they were actually the poorest men in the village, since chiefs were expected constantly to give everything away. They were also expected to set an example by working much harder than everybody else") /in good times the chiefs had no means to enforce order/


Also the Nambikwara lived in a mixed mode: 'dispersing into foraging bands at one time of year, gathering
together in concentrated settlements at another'

Howeve the consensus among anthropologist was towards the ladder of social evolution (like Turgot)

----

The remains of the 'princes' of the ice age (individuals who were buried with big grave gifts) were no regular individuals (were hunchbacks, dwarfs or very tall). He says that this is a sign they were not part of a hereditary elite (? what about health problems of pharaos ?) /anyway: just like the big bad guy in the movie Mad max 2.../

Says societies were similar to Nawmbigwara, with very big changes of lifestile, depending on the season of year.
also: "monuments of Göbekli Tepe. Activities around the stone temples correspond with periods of annual superabundance, between midsummer and autumn, when large herds of gazelle descended on to the Harran Plain" so that seasonal abundance of food would fuel seasonal collective construction work.

These patterns continued into agriculture - says Stonehenge is also framing midsumer sunrise and midwinter sunset!!! (although at stStonehenge they had abandoned agriculture and were somewhere in between foraging and keeping herds)

Marcel Mauss and Henri Beuchat’s (1903): 'circumpolar Inuit ‘and likewise many other societies … have two social structures, one in summer and one in winter, and that in parallel they have two systems of law and religion’. In the summer, Inuit dispersed into bands of roughly twenty or thirty people to pursue freshwater fish, caribou and reindeer, all under the authority of a single male elder. During this period, property was possessively marked and patriarchs exercised coercive, sometimes even tyrannical power over their kin – much more so than the Nambikwara chiefs in the dry season. But in the long winter months, when seals and walrus flocked to the Arctic shore, there was a dramatic reversal.  Then, Inuit gathered together to build great meeting houses of wood, whale rib and stone; within these houses, virtues of equality, altruism and collective life prevailed. Wealth was shared, and husbands and wives exchanged partners under the aegis of Sedna, the Goddess of the Sea'....

Franz Boas studying the e Kwakiut - in northwest Canada: 'in winter ... was the time when society
crystallized into its most hierarchical forms, and spectacularly so. Plankbuilt palaces sprang to life along the coastline of British Columbia, with hereditary nobles holding court over compatriots classified as commoners and slaves, and hosting the great banquets known as potlatch. Yet these aristocratic courts broke apart for the summer work of the fishing season, reverting to smaller clan formations – still ranked, but with entirely different and much less formal structures. In this case, people actually adopted different names in summer and winter – literally becoming someone else, depending on the time of year.'

similar seasonal variations in some indigenous Americans...

- all this shows quite a lot of experimentation and flexibility with social structure!!!

--- 

Pierre Clastres: people were politically self-conscience if they were 'building up hierarchies then dismantling them again'. (? my question: maybe they were just adjusting to the circumstances, and agriculture gave us a permanent year cycle and permanent social order ?)

/ later: no there were the Calusa kings, when spain arrived in America. Very hierarchical society, but pre-agricultural base! /

Why didn't Chiefs grab all of the power? Clastres says that the general population in classless societies 'more capable than we are of imagining alternative social orders, and therefore had created ‘societies against the state’. They had self-consciously organized in such a way that the forms of arbitrary power and domination we associate with ‘advanced political systems’ could never possibly emerge'

Lowie: "Since the chiefly office is effectively designed so it can never be turned into a means of compulsion, the only way state-like authority could possibly have emerged was from religious visionaries"

Now anarchist antropologists are asking: how did social inequality become the norm and how did we loose this flexibility with social structure?

- however seasinality is "still with us" in a weaker form -"Holiday season in December" or "August vacations". And some cultures have temporary reversal of social norms on holidays (like carnivals with their carnival kings)

"our early ancestors were not just our cognitive equals, but our intellectual peers too. Likely as not, they grappled with the paradoxes of social order and creativity just as much as we do; and understood them – at least the most reflexive among them – just as much, which also means just as little. They were perhaps more aware of some things and less aware of others. They were neither ignorant savages nor wise sons and daughters of nature. They were, as Helena Valero said of the Yanomami, just people, like us; equally perceptive, equally confused"

Another argument: people in hunter-gatherer/combined societies were always on the move, and travelled amazing distances (that's when cultues were more or less the same) - that's when cultures were uniform and people could just leave 'including taking the first available exit route if one’s personal freedoms were threatened at home'
(later: the right to travel was an important actual freedom: therefore there was a cultural obligation of hospitality to strangers! 'Mutual aid ...  was seen as the necessary condition for individual autonomy)

however at 12000  BC they start to see more regional differences - in diet and tools: grinding tools, tool kits. (Mesolithic - medium stone age period)  Now it gets harder to just get up and leave they say that the "proliferation of separate social and cultural universes – confined in space and relatively bounded – must have contributed in various ways to the emergence of more durable and intransigent forms of domination" (but no: then he talks a lot about production surpluses and how these enabled social stratification/inequality and the state)

Now he gets wavy: says egalitarianism society have the consensus that the 'main thing' should be distibuted equally (no surpluses) 
like the Hadza)  .
'Truly egalitarian societies, for Woodburn, are those with ‘immediate return’ economies: food brought home is eaten the same day or the next; anything extra is shared out, but never preserved or stored'
they avoid surpluses on purpose: 'egalitarian foragers understand all this perfectly well, and as a result they self-consciously avoid stockpiling resources or engaging in any long term project.

Eleanor Leacock : "most members of what are called egalitarian societies seem less interested in equality per se than what she calls ‘autonomy'" being to live their lives without outside interference. 

Many Indian societies (like the Wendat) had hierarchies that were largely 'theatrical', while people had effective freedom to travel (not conditioned as now on having enough money). 

However sometimes these distinctions are not well understood: 'Kathleen Gough showed that, ... (Nuer) couldn't really speak of equality of status here: males in Nuer communities were divided between ‘aristocrats’ (with ancestral connections to the territories where they live), ‘strangers’ and lowly war captives taken by force in raids on other communities... difference in rank implied differential access to women. Only the aristocrats could easily assemble enough cattle to arrange what Nuer considered a ‘proper’ marriage – that is, one in which they could claim paternity over the children and thus be remembered as ancestors after their death'
However 'differences in wealth (cattle) never translated into the ability to give orders, or to demand formal obeisance' (me: however 'different access to women' is not 'theatrical' also 'properly married' means husband can tell his wife what to do and that only he is sleeping with her)

---

again asking: how did we get stuck in hierarchies?

It appears there are many big sites of pre-agricultural age, which are very enigmatic
- Goeblekki-Teppe
- poverty creek
- lots of sites in Japan - Jomon
- Finnland: Jätinkirkko
- Big wood monument (Lake Shigirskoe, Ural) burials in Karelia/Scandinavia

However the focus is always on the agricultural age (because we know something about it?)
Authors say its a conspirarcy to keep the image of the naive foragers alive

Also picture of simplicity played a role in disposession of indigenous populations: "nineteenth-century jurists came to call the ‘Agricultural Argument ... blanket assertion that foraging peoples really were living in a State of Nature – which meant that they were deemed to be part of the land but had no legal claims to own it. The entire basis for dispossession, in turn, was premised on the idea that the current inhabitants of those lands weren’t really working. The argument goes back to John Locke’s Second Treatise of Government (1690), in which he argued that property rights are necessarily derived from labour "

---

now it gets extremely speculative, as they theorize on what might have happened in the early Holocene...
Speculates: the big building sites were all sacred/holy sites.

why? James Woodburn: 'In Hadza religion and the religions of many Pygmy groups, initiation into male (and sometimes female) cults forms the basis of exclusive claims to ownership, usually of ritual privileges, that stand in absolute contrast to the minimization of exclusive property rights in everyday, secular life'
'Now, these sacred items are, in many cases, the only important and exclusive forms of property that exist in societies where personal autonomy is taken to be a paramount value' - as the sacred is creating a 'structure of exclusion'- as the sacred is 'set apart' from the ordinary.

'Among Plains societies of North America, for instance, sacred bundles (which normally included not only physical objects but accompanying dances, rituals and songs) were often the only objects in that society to be treated as private property: not just owned exclusively by individuals, but also inherited, bought and sold.'


---
cultural differences: not every society was layed back: Indigenous population of the pacific coast ...  forragers societies 'were notorious for their industry and, in many cases, near-obsession with the accumulation of wealth' but didn't like the idea of agriculture. 

Kwakiutl of Vancouver Island: 'surround themselves with endless piles of possessions, but they also put endless creativity into designing and crafting them, with results so striking and intricately beautiful as to make them the pride of ethnographic museums the world over.'  

cultural differentiation is thought to occur along linguistic boundaries, forming 'ethno-linguisic' groups
But the authors say that is arbitrary.

    https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/10/16/the-first-free-market-reform-00061230#:~:text=On%20May%2012%2C%201776%2C%20Louis,Turgot%20was%20a%20visionary.

    Turgot was a big laissez-faire economist (like Adam Smith). 

    Was intendant of Limoges region, lots of reforms that were successful
    Louis XVI appointed him finance minister (royal intendant).
    Now he liberalized grain trade - this had a big effect...
        
    "In times of poor harvest, the crown capped grain prices, kept emergency stores and facilitated grain distribution. Additionally, a number of powerful players — including the king’s brothers — made a fortune on tolls and various grain taxes. Turgot’s Letters on the Liberty of the Grain Trade (1770) was based on the simple equation that if the crown removed its caps, guarantees, protections and other tolls, the grain trade would prosper and the market would expand, thus bringing more profits to farmers and lower prices to consumers."

    Now the system of bread subsidies and grain stores/emergency was disrupted, 1776 - as a result of this liberalization.

    bad harvest ... famine, riots. They say the riots bred a movement of opposition that resulted in the revolution.

    /still they mention grain imports from Poland - in passing.../

    (may be a bit one sided - as they are pushing their argument against neo-liberalism - politico/

    /interesting that wikipedia didn't mention that... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Robert_Jacques_Turgot /
    

The authors ideal social structure seems to be some kind of anarchism.
Now I don't know about anarchism, but had some experience with state socialism:
the problem with socialism:

- tragedy of the commongs: everyone tries to increase his private gain by steeling from the shared property - which turns into 'no-ones property'.
- kills initiative and then excludes/sidelines those whoe have initiative
- see any change of the status quo as threat. feels threatened by change.
- does not invest in the future, prefers short term gains over long term investment (due to first point).
- the state bureacracy is not got at running an economy. It can be good at mobilizing everything into one task (like winning a war). Problems: state machinery is riddled with internal conflicts of interest and not stellar at information processing.
- the stuff is declared to belong to everyone, so no-one cares. 
- What Marx calls: alienation/entfremdung (it is a big thing in state socialism)

(in one word Pofigizm...)

end of me ranting:

How did socialism get popular among younger people in America? (see it on reddit)
Looks like it has something to do with student loans, fewer employment opportunities, etc. perceived 'greed' of the system.

The book:

Where do we come from?

    Rousseau 'Discourse on the Origin and the Foundation of Inequality Among Mankind' - initial state: small bands of hunter gathereres living in harmony and equality (everyone being poor) - until the invention of agriculture (here comes private property on land that needs to be protected) and cities (money, debt, state, bueraucracies, economic specialization), later: Fukuyama,Diamond - hierarchies form with more complex organization forms (bands -> tribes -> chiefdoms -> kingdoms). (contemprary Rousseau fans study: Hadza, Pygmies or !Kung)
Then comes the surplus and all sorts of people start to appropriate and live on it: priests, warriors ... scholars: they band togather to defend their interests/assets: here we have a state.    

Hobbes Leviathan - initial state: everyone is fighting everyone else. 'Hierarchy and domination, and cynical self-interest, have always been the basis of human society. ' It needs a repressive machine to civilize us. Pinker: along these lines - we never had it so good, early humans were brutish and life was short (lots of cherrypicking: Romito2 burial has corpses with genetic defects, these people had to be cared for by the community) Contemprary Hobbes fans study: Yanomami in the amazon (because early ethonographer painted them as especially fierce, because they gain advantage in their society by killing other men - but the discussion around that got very heated)

    Authors say the intial state is more varied, lots of experiments 'Agriculture, in turn, did not mean the inception of private property, nor did it mark an irreversible step towards inequality. In fact, many of the first farming communities were relatively free of ranks and hierarchies'. 

    Says we also need to consider different voices, not just european scholars, also other archaologiceal findings than what we got used to.

    Says he doesn't like both of them: both implies that current state can't be changed, because it is 'determined by the nature of things', current state becomes inevitable as 'you can't go back to tribal formation'
    Also: there must have been some experimentation in the field of social organization - people were living for a damn long time, tens of thousands of years until 3000BC. The idea that there were and are alternatives - that's what he aims for...

Problems: Enlightenment thinkers who propounded ideals of freedom/equality/democracy almost invariably put them in the mouths of foreigners, even ‘savages’. This is hardly surprising, since it’s almost impossible to find a single author in that Western tradition, from Plato to Marcus Aurelius to Erasmus, who did not make it clear that they would have been opposed to such ideas ... until the 19th century these ideas didn't gain ground in Europe! (taking these ideas as exclusively European is also whitewashing collonialism - as Europe brought them the light, 'white mans burden')

Quotes Benjamin Franklin: he says most persons who had the choice between living with the natives and in the 'west' were choosing ... to stay with the natives.

Early evidence of previous objects traveling long distances: this can have many interpretations (not just market economy)
    - Iroquean do long quests to satisfy some dream/vision. (vision quests)
    - traveling healers/entertaieners - their rewards can travel a long way.
    - gambling: women like to gamble on some exotic stuff

Says the narrative of Hobbes vs Rousseau doesn't leave lots of possibilities - 'Rather than asking how we ended up
unequal, we will start by asking how it was that ‘inequality’ became such an issue to begin with,'

----

Where did Rousseau come from? 

won first price in essay competition of the Academie on 'Has the restoration of the sciences and arts contributed to moral improvement?' Rosseau: 'answered with no, Our elementary moral intuitions, he asserted, are fundamentally decent and sound; civilization merely corrupts by encouraging us to value form over content' ; ' first humans were essentially good, but nonetheless systematically avoided one another for fear of violence'


In 1754 the Academie announced a essay competition on 'what is the origin of inequality among men, and is it authorized by natural law?' - which is rather surprising question, given that France was an extremely hierarchical society. Says that's because the Enlightenment was trigered by the expansion of trades/colonies before that - suddenly Europe got in touch with the world (after having been the backwaters of the world during middle ages)

R. asks "How is it that Europeans are able to turn wealth into power; turn a mere unequal distribution of material goods – which exists, at least to some degree, in any society – into the ability to tell others what to do, to employ them as servants..?" ... answer is inspired by Lahontan or Jesuites. "Rousseau agrees, in essence, with Kandiaronk’s view that civilized Europeans were, by and large, atrocious creatures, for all the reasons that the Wendat had outlined; and he agrees that property is the root of the problem"
also says that Indians are better off than europeans: ‘the Savages of Canada, notwithstanding their Poverty, are richer than you, among whom all sorts of crimes are committed upon the score of Mine and Thine.’ (later: Indians work less and can get more with less effort)

" If we ask, not ‘what are the origins of social inequality?’ but ‘what are the origins of the question about the origins of social inequality?’ (in other words, how did it come about that, in 1754, the Académie de Dijon would think this an appropriate question to ask?), then we are immediately confronted with a long history of Europeans arguing with one another about the nature of faraway societies"

/later: the question is strange: " apart from the implications of primordial innocence, this way of framing the problem suggests a certain diagnosis of what is wrong with society, and what can and can’t be done about it" /

Says there was quite some discussion between native americans and europeans - on a philosophical level!

"For European audiences, the indigenous critique would come as a shock to the system, revealing possibilities for human emancipation that, once disclosed, could hardly be ignored."

claims that the notion of 'equality' was very alien to european philosophy/thinkers, that came from the debate on 'natural law' in 17th cent. Pizarro and Cortez conquered without direct authorization, the 'natural law' debate discussed if that action was legal, the problem is that natives were not heathens, as they didn't know about christian religion, should they be treated as heathens? "The legal and philosophical question then became: what rights do human beings have simply by dint of being human – that is, what rights could they be said to have ‘naturally’, even if they existed in a State of Nature,"

That was the starting point for Hobbes,Locke to elaborate on that starting point: what was the original state of nature?

- says this is the setting where opinions of natives becomes important - as showing some alternative to the european state (assumed to be the only right and eternal truth) 
/this kind of literaure by missionaries and discussions with 'savages' suddenly becomes very important, but philosophers like to ignore any input by non-europeans - it goes against their dogma/

indigineous thinkers criticised the lack of freedom in the European 'way of life', 17th century travel literature ' exposed its readers to this kind of criticism, along with providing a sense of social possibility'

--

Says the notion of 'noble savages' is because men dealt with hunting and fighting  - that's what european aristocrats were doing (women indians were farming)

Miqmaq indians are quoted "‘They consider themselves better than the French: “For,” they say, “you are always fighting and quarrelling among yourselves; we live peaceably. You are envious and are all the time slandering each other; you are thieves and deceivers; you are covetous, and are neither generous nor kind; as for us, if we have a morsel of bread we share it with our neighbour" ... "Mi’kmaq would constantly assert that they were, as a result, ‘richer’ than the French. The French had more material possessions, the Mi’kmaq conceded; but they had other, greater assets: ease, comfort and time." (isn't that what Russian nationalists say about the west?)

"In the considered opinion of the Montagnais-Naskapi, however, the French were little better than slaves, living in constant terror of their superiors."

The Jesuites were trained in classics and were arguign with the Indians, yet 'were impressed by the quality of the counterarguments they had to contend with. How could such rhetorical facility have come to those with no awareness of the works of Varro and Quintilian?'

(me: is it possible that Jesuites weren't exactly big fans of modernity, and were using the indigenous argument against it as their tool against something they did not partiularly like? Sort of like in Zauberberg of Thomas Man!!)

'speakers of Iroquoian languages such as the Wendat, or the five Haudenosaunee nations to their south, who appear to have placed such weight on reasoned debate' where the Chief had to persuade his people, otherwise they don't follow.
'it appears to have been exactly this form of debate – rational, sceptical, empirical, conversational in tone – which before long came to be identified with the European Enlightenment as well.' and both came with rejection of 'arbitrary authority'.

/me: now go and have a society that produces complex tools and products with a egalitarian tribe structure, without money exchange and debt financing, laws, etc.../

book: Lahontan "Curious Dialogues with a Savage of Good Sense Who Has Travelle" 1703 - conversations with native Adario/Kandiaorank of unusual eloquence, the book was quite influential, says these were not made up.
Lahontan tells that natives held their way of life as superior, adds criticism of private property ‘They think it unaccountable that one man should have more than another, and that the rich should have more respect than the poor. In short, they say, the name of savages, which we bestow upon them, would fit ourselves better, since there is nothing in our actions that bears an appearance of wisdom.’ (though earlier the authors say that the fields were property of the Women, and the mens property were his weapons, etc - but  that they shared the harves/spoils of war)
Lahontan quotes Kandiaronk's criticism of western civiliztion 'he perceived failure of European societies to promote mutual aid and protect personal liberties'

- no punitive laws in native societies because there is no money. (so no need to enforce debts/contracts?)
  (well says 'no laws' - but the Wendat had their own law codex, therefore the whole dialoge was held to be forged)
- suggests Europe should adopt the ways of the Wendat, by accepting abstract 'equality'


Is such a deep dialog plausible? Says yes - because of schizmogenesis : defining themselfes as the opposite of the other:

    Says on the one hand Europeans and native americans learned from each other:
    // ? Americans began using European muskets; European settlers began to adopt more indulgent American approaches to disciplining children ?
    But on the other hand each side defined itself as being the opposite of the other (sharpening their differences!)

Influence of this book: lots of other authors wrote critiques of western civilization voiced by 'savage sages'.
". Montesquieu chose a Persian; the Marquis d’Argens a Chinese; Diderot a Tahitian; Chateaubriand a Natchez; Voltaire’s L’Ingénu was half Wendat and half French"
    
'between 1703 and 1751, ... the indigenous American critique of European society had an enormous impact on European thought. What began as widespread expressions of outrage and distaste by Americans (when first exposed to European mores) eventually evolved, ...  into an argument about the nature of authority, decency, social responsibility and, above all, freedom. As it became clear to French observers that most indigenous Americans saw individual autonomy and freedom of action as consummate values – organizing their own lives in such a way as to minimize any possibility of one human being becoming subordinated to the will of another, and hence viewing French society as essentially one of fractious slaves' 
(also: 'In the (native) American view, the freedom of the individual was assumed to be premised on a certain level of ‘baseline communism’, since, after all, people who are starving or lack adequate clothes or shelter in a snowstorm are not really free to do much of anything, other than whatever it takes to stay alive' in contrast: "The European conception of individual freedom was, by contrast, tied ineluctably to notions of private property" ... "In this view, freedom was always defined – at least potentially – as something exercised to the cost of others. What’s more, there was a strong emphasis in ancient Roman (and modern European) law on the self-sufficiency of households; hence, true freedom meant autonomy in the radical sense, not just autonomy of the will, but being in no way dependent on other human beings"

----

POV of the West changes with Turgot in 1751: critique of a book Madame de Graffigny about Incas (this society is not egalitarian at all)
Turgot: equality possible  'is possible in a society where each household is largely self-sufficient and, therefore, where everyone is equally poor' with more complex production trade this equality gets lots. 
'The only alternative, according to him, would be massive, Inca-style state intervention to create a uniformity of social conditions: an enforced equality which could only have the effect of crushing all initiative and, therefore, result in economic and social catastrophe' (!!!)
Says that 'technological progress as (the main) driver for overall social improvement' (!!!)


Later Turgot argued for staged ladder of social evolution: " social evolution, he reasoned, always begins with hunters, then moves on to a stage of pastoralism, then farming, and only then finally passes to the contemporary stage of urban commercial civilization" - meaning that a society is defined by their mode of subsistence. /in a way the first stage to declaring indigenous societies as primitive/

/says the main englightenment view evolve as the direct reaction to the critique by native americans!!!/

Says Rousseau's essays incorporate the indigenous critique of European society (mirror Kandiaronk), critique of private property as the source of inequality and lack of liberty + doctrine of progress = the birth of the left, as an 'intellectual project' (but he is alone in not writing some 'dialogue' - his savages are thought experiments)


... "But we can argue that, in folding together the indigenous critique and the doctrine of progress originally developed to counter it, Rousseau did in fact write the founding document of the left as an intellectual project"

.... 

Rosseau on the origin of inequality: for him the Indians are naive and could not imagine what would come out of the concept of proprty. 'He was just about the only major figure of the French Enlightenment who didn’t write a dialogue or other imaginative work attempting to look at European society from a foreign point of view. In fact, he strips his ‘savages’ of any imaginative powers of their own; their happiness is entirely derived from their inability to imagine things'
that's a kind of 'myth of the stupid savage' .... later 'Nineteenthcentury imperialists adopted the stereotype enthusiastically, merely adding on a variety of ostensibly scientific justifications – from Darwinian evolutionism to ‘scientific’ racism –'


/general observation: they tendedto portray indigenous populations as naive: part of this was the question of leasure. In Victorian times it was assumed that 'things are only getting better' and that modern people have more leasure. The opposite is true! Now if you assume that someone is always busy searching for food then he does not have time for anything else!

The truth is they worked much less then later on. Also planting was just too time-consuming for them "They just didn’t see any reason why they should. ‘Why should we plant,’ one !Kung informant put it – in a phrase cited ever since in a thousand treatises on the origins of farming – ‘when there are so many mongongo nuts in the world?’ ... such foragers had ‘rejected the Neolithic Revolution in order to keep their leisure" ... but that's only some of them, you can't generalize...

What about conservatives? How do they react?

    - in 1859 some guys took over the British Ethnological society and "called for the extermination of inferior people". These guys invented the term 'noble savage' as a ridicule.
    - Gilbert Chinard in 1913: says Rousseau got some ideas from the dialoges with Kandiaorank, also says the Jesuites  "promoted ‘dangerous ideas’ in giving us the impression of the good qualities of ‘savages’"
        (Chinard held Jesuites responsible for entertaining dangerous ideas that inspired Rousseau and therefore 'gave rise to revolutionary spirits')

says the right took to inventing the 'myth of the noble savage' - as a caricature of the left, as an attack on the left.

... long section on why the slogan 'egalite' is ... not defined at all. (equality for who and in what sense?)

===

What about the origin of the human species? We don't know much, there is a lot of guessing. Only tangible thing is anthropology.
Are we just bullying apes (called dominance-submissive behavior)? Now human society has lots of tools to restrain bullying behavior, says Boehm: ridicule, shame, shunning..
Boehm says that this is a choice, kind of "they understand what their society might look like if they did things differently: if, for instance, skilled hunters were not systematically belittled,..."

(Me: in Russian they would say 'ne vysovyvajsja'... guess any collectivist society would have an equivalent for that...)

nice observation: "The solution to the battle between ‘Hobbesian hawks and Rousseauian doves’ turns out to be: our genetic nature is Hobbesian, but our political history is pretty much exactly as described by Rousseau."

===

Still they found ice age burials near Brno and Dordogne (France), with lots of decorations, mamoth teeth, etc. This is not a sign of everyone beeing equal... And no one knows what happened at Göbekli Tepe or Yudinovo - they guess that ‘hunter-gatherer societies had evolved institutions to support major public works, projects, and monumental constructions, and thus had a complex social hierarchy


So maybe we were structural societies all along, and ther was no 'golden egalitarian age' after all?

Still these are sporadic things, they don't see other signs of of stratifications like bigger houses or special storehouses for the elites, etc.

So maybe some bands were highly centralized 'like chimps' and others were egalitarian 'like bonobos' ?
Authors say this comparison is misleading: groups had the social organization because of their own conscious choice! Apparently they had lots of discussions, even before writing.

However: 'over the course of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries it was political self-consciousness that European philosophers came to see as some kind of amazing historical achievement: as a phenomenon which only really became possible with the Enlightenment itself, and the subsequent American and French Revolutions' in contrast to that 'Like many North American peoples of his time, Kandiaronk’s Wendat nation saw their society as a confederation created by conscious agreement; agreements open to continual renegotiation.'

However Rousseau and his band regarded them all as primitive, incapable of political thought with a 'pre-logical mentality'.

says real anthropologists don't regard native people as primitive.

also: indigineous societies tolerate excentricity, because they don't have institutionalized coercion.
So among these excentrics they have prophets, priests, bulls (operator types), leaders - argues that there must have been quite some level of experementation in the social field...

Levi strauss: antropologist who came up with the idea that indigenous people are just like people in modern societies:
studied the Nambikwara tribe in Brazil, observed that their chiefs were just the same as modern politicians.
"they resembled modern politicians operating tiny embryonic welfare states, pooling resources and doling them out to those in need. What impressed Lévi-Strauss above all was their political maturity. It was the chiefs’ skill in directing small bands of dry-season foragers, of making snap decisions in crises (crossing a river, directing a hunt) that later qualified them to play the role of mediators and diplomats in the village plaza." 

(later: "their houses might have resembled social service dispensaries in modern welfare states; but as a result, in terms of material wealth, they were actually the poorest men in the village, since chiefs were expected constantly to give everything away. They were also expected to set an example by working much harder than everybody else") /in good times the chiefs had no means to enforce order/


Also the Nambikwara lived in a mixed mode: 'dispersing into foraging bands at one time of year, gathering
together in concentrated settlements at another'

Howeve the consensus among anthropologist was towards the ladder of social evolution (like Turgot)

----

The remains of the 'princes' of the ice age (individuals who were buried with big grave gifts) were no regular individuals (were hunchbacks, dwarfs or very tall). He says that this is a sign they were not part of a hereditary elite (? what about health problems of pharaos ?) /anyway: just like the big bad guy in the movie Mad max 2.../

Says societies were similar to Nawmbigwara, with very big changes of lifestile, depending on the season of year.
also: "monuments of Göbekli Tepe. Activities around the stone temples correspond with periods of annual superabundance, between midsummer and autumn, when large herds of gazelle descended on to the Harran Plain" so that seasonal abundance of food would fuel seasonal collective construction work.

These patterns continued into agriculture - says Stonehenge is also framing midsumer sunrise and midwinter sunset!!! (although at stStonehenge they had abandoned agriculture and were somewhere in between foraging and keeping herds)

Marcel Mauss and Henri Beuchat’s (1903): 'circumpolar Inuit ‘and likewise many other societies … have two social structures, one in summer and one in winter, and that in parallel they have two systems of law and religion’. In the summer, Inuit dispersed into bands of roughly twenty or thirty people to pursue freshwater fish, caribou and reindeer, all under the authority of a single male elder. During this period, property was possessively marked and patriarchs exercised coercive, sometimes even tyrannical power over their kin – much more so than the Nambikwara chiefs in the dry season. But in the long winter months, when seals and walrus flocked to the Arctic shore, there was a dramatic reversal.  Then, Inuit gathered together to build great meeting houses of wood, whale rib and stone; within these houses, virtues of equality, altruism and collective life prevailed. Wealth was shared, and husbands and wives exchanged partners under the aegis of Sedna, the Goddess of the Sea'....

Franz Boas studying the e Kwakiut - in northwest Canada: 'in winter ... was the time when society
crystallized into its most hierarchical forms, and spectacularly so. Plankbuilt palaces sprang to life along the coastline of British Columbia, with hereditary nobles holding court over compatriots classified as commoners and slaves, and hosting the great banquets known as potlatch. Yet these aristocratic courts broke apart for the summer work of the fishing season, reverting to smaller clan formations – still ranked, but with entirely different and much less formal structures. In this case, people actually adopted different names in summer and winter – literally becoming someone else, depending on the time of year.'

similar seasonal variations in some indigenous Americans...

- all this shows quite a lot of experimentation and flexibility with social structure!!!

--- 

Pierre Clastres: people were politically self-conscience if they were 'building up hierarchies then dismantling them again'. (? my question: maybe they were just adjusting to the circumstances, and agriculture gave us a permanent year cycle and permanent social order ?)

/ later: no there were the Calusa kings, when spain arrived in America. Very hierarchical society, but pre-agricultural base! /

Why didn't Chiefs grab all of the power? Clastres says that the general population in classless societies 'more capable than we are of imagining alternative social orders, and therefore had created ‘societies against the state’. They had self-consciously organized in such a way that the forms of arbitrary power and domination we associate with ‘advanced political systems’ could never possibly emerge'

Lowie: "Since the chiefly office is effectively designed so it can never be turned into a means of compulsion, the only way state-like authority could possibly have emerged was from religious visionaries"

Now anarchist antropologists are asking: how did social inequality become the norm and how did we loose this flexibility with social structure?

- however seasinality is "still with us" in a weaker form -"Holiday season in December" or "August vacations". And some cultures have temporary reversal of social norms on holidays (like carnivals with their carnival kings)

"our early ancestors were not just our cognitive equals, but our intellectual peers too. Likely as not, they grappled with the paradoxes of social order and creativity just as much as we do; and understood them – at least the most reflexive among them – just as much, which also means just as little. They were perhaps more aware of some things and less aware of others. They were neither ignorant savages nor wise sons and daughters of nature. They were, as Helena Valero said of the Yanomami, just people, like us; equally perceptive, equally confused"

Another argument: people in hunter-gatherer/combined societies were always on the move, and travelled amazing distances (that's when cultues were more or less the same) - that's when cultures were uniform and people could just leave 'including taking the first available exit route if one’s personal freedoms were threatened at home'
(later: the right to travel was an important actual freedom: therefore there was a cultural obligation of hospitality to strangers! 'Mutual aid ...  was seen as the necessary condition for individual autonomy)

however at 12000  BC they start to see more regional differences - in diet and tools: grinding tools, tool kits. (Mesolithic - medium stone age period)  Now it gets harder to just get up and leave they say that the "proliferation of separate social and cultural universes – confined in space and relatively bounded – must have contributed in various ways to the emergence of more durable and intransigent forms of domination" (but no: then he talks a lot about production surpluses and how these enabled social stratification/inequality and the state)

Now he gets wavy: says egalitarianism society have the consensus that the 'main thing' should be distibuted equally (no surpluses) 
like the Hadza)  .
'Truly egalitarian societies, for Woodburn, are those with ‘immediate return’ economies: food brought home is eaten the same day or the next; anything extra is shared out, but never preserved or stored'
they avoid surpluses on purpose: 'egalitarian foragers understand all this perfectly well, and as a result they self-consciously avoid stockpiling resources or engaging in any long term project.

Eleanor Leacock : "most members of what are called egalitarian societies seem less interested in equality per se than what she calls ‘autonomy'" being to live their lives without outside interference. 

Many Indian societies (like the Wendat) had hierarchies that were largely 'theatrical', while people had effective freedom to travel (not conditioned as now on having enough money). 

However sometimes these distinctions are not well understood: 'Kathleen Gough showed that, ... (Nuer) couldn't really speak of equality of status here: males in Nuer communities were divided between ‘aristocrats’ (with ancestral connections to the territories where they live), ‘strangers’ and lowly war captives taken by force in raids on other communities... difference in rank implied differential access to women. Only the aristocrats could easily assemble enough cattle to arrange what Nuer considered a ‘proper’ marriage – that is, one in which they could claim paternity over the children and thus be remembered as ancestors after their death'
However 'differences in wealth (cattle) never translated into the ability to give orders, or to demand formal obeisance' (me: however 'different access to women' is not 'theatrical' also 'properly married' means husband can tell his wife what to do and that only he is sleeping with her)

---

again asking: how did we get stuck in hierarchies?

It appears there are many big sites of pre-agricultural age, which are very enigmatic
- Goeblekki-Teppe
- poverty creek
- lots of sites in Japan - Jomon
- Finnland: Jätinkirkko
- Big wood monument (Lake Shigirskoe, Ural) burials in Karelia/Scandinavia

However the focus is always on the agricultural age (because we know something about it?)
Authors say its a conspirarcy to keep the image of the naive foragers alive

Also picture of simplicity played a role in disposession of indigenous populations: "nineteenth-century jurists came to call the ‘Agricultural Argument ... blanket assertion that foraging peoples really were living in a State of Nature – which meant that they were deemed to be part of the land but had no legal claims to own it. The entire basis for dispossession, in turn, was premised on the idea that the current inhabitants of those lands weren’t really working. The argument goes back to John Locke’s Second Treatise of Government (1690), in which he argued that property rights are necessarily derived from labour "

---

now it gets extremely speculative, as they theorize on what might have happened in the early Holocene...
Speculates: the big building sites were all sacred/holy sites.

why? James Woodburn: 'In Hadza religion and the religions of many Pygmy groups, initiation into male (and sometimes female) cults forms the basis of exclusive claims to ownership, usually of ritual privileges, that stand in absolute contrast to the minimization of exclusive property rights in everyday, secular life'
'Now, these sacred items are, in many cases, the only important and exclusive forms of property that exist in societies where personal autonomy is taken to be a paramount value' - as the sacred is creating a 'structure of exclusion'- as the sacred is 'set apart' from the ordinary.

'Among Plains societies of North America, for instance, sacred bundles (which normally included not only physical objects but accompanying dances, rituals and songs) were often the only objects in that society to be treated as private property: not just owned exclusively by individuals, but also inherited, bought and sold.'


---
cultural differences: not every society was layed back: Indigenous population of the pacific coast ...  forragers societies 'were notorious for their industry and, in many cases, near-obsession with the accumulation of wealth' but didn't like the idea of agriculture. 

Kwakiutl of Vancouver Island: 'surround themselves with endless piles of possessions, but they also put endless creativity into designing and crafting them, with results so striking and intricately beautiful as to make them the pride of ethnographic museums the world over.'  

cultural differentiation is thought to occur along linguistic boundaries, forming 'ethno-linguisic' groups or groupings by region.
But the authors say that is both arbitrary.

Boas: map it by 'cultural traits' - (pottery style, music style, games, style of warrior society) /? aren't the last two the same ?/
later: Clark Wissler: create map of regional systems - by aestetic styles, cusine, social orginization.

criticism: Mauss - says people travelled much more over longer distances, so that 'cultural diffusion' is rubbish.
Mauss: cultures are structures of refusal, they define themselves by not accepting a set of inputs from other cultures.
Mauss: "Societies live by borrowing from each other, but they define themselves rather by the refusal of
borrowing than by its acceptance."

take two neighboring tribes:
- north-west US/Canada: tribes relied on fishing, elaborate rituals, art: elaborate woodwork, totem poles decorated houses, . Lots of wars - and lots of hereditary slaves (a quarter of the population were slaves!) Hereditary hierarchies, court societies jockeying for titles and grand palaces. Feastof potlatch - shows of excess and gluttony ('sometimes culminated in the sacrificial killing of slaves'!!!)
- California and south: foragers (and hunters/fishers), *fewer* slaves. Art: baskets for gathering food. Very modest rulers. 'no inherited ranks or titles, ' ... 'absence of formal ranks',  in contrast: feasts are more modest: staple foods served, playful dances
(at first the says the Yurok did not have slaves, however later: 'Yurok, for example, did hold a small number of slaves, mainly debt peons or captives not yet ransomed by their relatives')

  Goldschmidt: Yurok tribe living here - says they had their form of shell-money - and their culture placed an emphasis on earning this money (says everything was privately owned) - similarities with 'protestant work ethic'!. also: 'Yurok men scrupulously avoided being placed in a situation of debt or ongoing obligation to anyone else. Even the collective management of resources was frowned upon; foraging grounds were individually owned and could be rented out in times of shortfall'
Role of money in general "employed to pay fines, and as a way of forming and remembering compacts and agreements"
role of money for the Yurok "money buys everything – wealth, resources, food, honor and wives"
    later: Maidu, Winto, Pomo nations more to the south rejected slavery entireley, also they burned the money/wealth ofa person, when he died (unlike  the Yurok).

author says they were defining their cultures as a way to differentiate between themselves and their neighbors - therefore the big differences. (schismogenesis, maybe like Athens and Sparta) 
So asks: what eplains the differences? 'did the ethos come first – a certain conception of the nature of humanity and its role in the cosmos – and did the institutional structures emerge from that?' or is the 'mode of production' that is to blame ?

- says slavery in nothern tribes started around 1850BC - when they started to harvest salmon fish runs (needs lots of workers for that) also at that time they see ornaments at graves of elites. also fortifications start to appear around 1500BC.

You also had slavery in south america, so they called societies with this institution  "capturing societies" (Fernando Santos-Graero)

says common to institution of slavery: social death - the enslaved person can not enter contracts/interact with society.
also the slave is a kind of 'pet' (???)

in California: why would Yurok rely on nuts instead of relying on fish (like in the north?)
In terms of food security - fish is more nutritious and 'more reliable' than nuts.
However fish need to be prepared for storage (fileted, dried and smoked, fish oil) - and you need to defend storage areas, that makes a priced target for attack, so you *must* be more warlike, however you don't need to defend nuts...
Hhowever you need to bleech and grind nuts, that's hard work, and nut harvest can vary, so food security is more of an issue.

The question of values:

- on slavery: says north west needs slave, as aristocracy can't be bothered to clean smelly fish, and freemen were often into art, so they could not be bothered. They got a quarter of the population as slaves - to get a pool of reliable laborers!
- in california they took pride in hard workd and frugality - unlike a 'care nothing' attitude in the north. Also: their value system seems to be in opposition to that of the north: 
   - ceremonial clowns, their role is to be gluttons and 
   - culture: emphasison inner self through discipline and work (as opposed to showman art of the north) ; also they don't have masks in art (in the north it is all about elaborate 'world of masks, illusion and facade')
   - later: 'intense focus on obtaining money, and resultant puritanism, and also the strong moral opposition to slave-raiding' ... as the result of opposing their nothern neighbors.
    
long treatise on what counts - nature or nurture?
    - authors don't like any kind of determines - there is always a choice.
    - authors also don't like structuralism: here everything is explained by language and its properties (language speaks us)
