#2196. Create Binary Tree From Descriptions
#Medium
#
#        If isLefti == 1, then childi is the left child of parenti.
#        If isLefti == 0, then childi is the right child of parenti.
#
#    Construct the binary tree described by descriptions and return its root.
#
#    The test cases will be generated such that the binary tree is valid.
#
#
#
#    Example 1:
#
#    Input: descriptions = [[20,15,1],[20,17,0],[50,20,1],[50,80,0],[80,19,1]]
#    Output: [50,20,80,15,17,19]
#    Explanation: The root node is the node with value 50 since it has no parent.
#    The resulting binary tree is shown in the diagram.
#
#    Example 2:
#
#    Input: descriptions = [[1,2,1],[2,3,0],[3,4,1]]
#    Output: [1,2,null,null,3,4]
#    Explanation: The root node is the node with value 1 since it has no parent.
#    The resulting binary tree is shown in the diagram.
#
#
#
#    Constraints:
#
#        1 <= descriptions.length <= 104
#        descriptions[i].length == 3
#        1 <= parenti, childi <= 105
#        0 <= isLefti <= 1
#        The binary tree described by descriptions is valid.
