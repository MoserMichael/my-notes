Just realized: ChatGTP isn't hallucinating, these are Androids who are dreaming of electric sheep!

Asked google bard why the movie Blade Runner is so much different from the book:

> the concept of the movie changed a lot during production, did unreleased versions of the move deal with the post-apocalyptic theme?
View other drafts

Yes, there are several unreleased versions of Blade Runner that deal with the post-apocalyptic theme. The most well-known of these is the workprint version, which was released in 1982. This version of the film is much longer than the theatrical release, and it includes several scenes that were cut from the final film. One of these scenes is a prologue that sets the film in the context of the post-apocalyptic world of the novel. In this scene, we see the aftermath of the nuclear war that has devastated the Earth. We see the ruins of cities, the bodies of the dead, and the survivors who are struggling to survive in a world that has been turned upside down.

The workprint version of Blade Runner also includes several other scenes that deal with the post-apocalyptic theme. For example, there is a scene where Deckard and Rachael visit a refugee camp where people who have been displaced by the war are living. There is also a scene where Deckard has a dream about a world that has been destroyed by nuclear fire.

The inclusion of these scenes in the workprint version of Blade Runner makes it clear that Ridley Scott originally intended for the film to be more faithful to the novel's post-apocalyptic setting. However, the studio ultimately decided to cut these scenes from the theatrical release in order to make the film more accessible to a wider audience.

Now I am re-reading "Do Androids dream of electric sheep" by Philip K Dick, so writing down the memorable phrases/scenes. 

/actually pasting out memorable phrases is a nice trick - for staying focused on the text, while you have half a hundred tab windows open in the web browser.../

"If you dial," Iran said, eyes open and watching, "for greater venom, then I'll dial the same. I'll dial
the maximum and you'll see a fight that makes every argument we've had up to now seem like
nothing. Dial and see; just try me." She rose swiftly, loped to the console of her own mood organ,
stood glaring at him, waiting."

 "My schedule for today lists a six-hour self-accusatory depression," Iran said.

 "But a mood like that," Rick said, "you're apt to stay in it, not dial your way out. Despair like that,
about total reality, is self-perpetuating."

"I can't dial a setting that stimulates my cerebral cortex into wanting to dial!

"But," Rick interrupted, "for you to have two horses and me none, that violates the whole basic
theological and moral structure of Mercerism."

"Medieval plagues had manifested themselves in a similar way, in the form of many dead rats. This plague, however, had descended from above"

" And, in dubious addition to them, occasional peculiar entities remained in the
virtually abandoned suburbs.
 John Isidore, being yammered at by the television set in his living room as he shaved in the
bathroom, was one of these."

"Upon him the contempt of three planets descended.
However, despite this, he survived."

"Better, perhaps, to turn the TV back on. But the ads, directed at the remaining regulars, frightened
him. They informed him in a countless procession of ways that he, a special, wasn't wanted. Had no
use. Could not, even if he wanted to, emigrate. So why listen to that? He asked himself irritably.
Fork them and their colonization"

" Not let him know I'm a chickenhead. If he finds out I'm a cliickenhead he
won't talk to me; that's always the way it is for some reason. I wonder why?"


"The Soviet police can't do any more
than we can,"

"Empathy, evidently, existed only
within the human community, whereas intelligence to some degree could be found throughout every
phylum and order including the arachnids. For one thing, the emphatic faculty probably required an
unimpaired group instinct; a solitary organism, such as a spider, would have no use for it; in fact it
would tend to abort a spider's ability to survive. It would make him conscious of the desire to live on
the part of his prey. Hence all predators, even highly developed mammals such as cats, would starve."

"A Mercerite sensed evil without understanding it. Put another way, a Mercerite was
free to locate the nebulous presence of The Killers wherever he saw fit."

"Experts, he realized. A mammoth corporation like this - it embodies too much experience. It
possesses in fact a sort of group mind. And Eldon and Rachael Rosen consisted of spokesmen for
that corporate entity. His mistake, evidently, had been in viewing them as individuals. It was a
mistake he would not make again."


"But an empathy box," he said, stammering in his excitement, "is the most personal possession you
have! It's an extension of your body; it's the way you touch other humans, it's the way you stop being
alone.

"But something about Buster Friendly irritated John Isidore, one specific thing. In subtle, almost
inconspicuous ways, Buster ridiculed the empathy boxes. Not once but many times. He was, in fact,
doing it right now. ... Maybe Buster is jealous, Isidore conjectured. Sure, that would explain it; he and
Wilbur Mercer are in competition. But for what?
Our minds, Isidore decided. They're fighting for control of our psychic selves; the empathy box on
one hand, Buster's guffaws and off-the-cuff jibes on the other."

"There is only one cat like Horace. He used to -
when he was just a kitten - stand and stare up at us as if asking a question. We never understood
what the question was. Maybe now he knows the answer." Fresh tears appeared. "I guess we all will
eventually."


" The deep-pile carpets, the expensive genuine wood desks, reminded him
that garbage collecting and trash disposal had, since the war, become one of Earth's important
industries. The entire planet had begun to disintegrate into junk, and to keep the planet habitable for
the remaining population the junk had to be hauled away occasionally . . . or, as Buster Friendly
liked to declare, Earth would die under a layer - not of radioactive dust - but of kipple."

"What kind of world is it, he asked himself, when an android
phones up a bounty hunter and offers him assistance? "

"It's a good thing I know something about opera, Rick reflected. That's another advantage I have
over Dave; I'm more culturally oriented."

"Too bad. And Mozart, not long after writing The Magic Flute, had died in his thirties - of
kidney disease. And had been buried in an unmarked paupers' grave.
Thinking this he wondered if Mozart had had any intuition that the future did not exist, that he had
already used up his little time. Maybe I have, too, Rick thought as he watched the rehearsal move
along. This rehearsal will end, the performance will end, the singers will die, eventually the last score
of the music will be destroyed in one way or another; finally the name "Mozart" will vanish, the dust
will have won. If not on this planet then another. We can evade it awhile. As the andys can evade me
and exist a finite stretch longer. But I get them or some other bounty hunter gets them. In a way, he
realized, I'm part of the form-destroying process of entropy. The Rosen Association creates and I
unmake. Or anyhow so it must seem to them."

"Who are you?" Her tone held cold reserve - and that other cold, which he had encountered in so
many androids. Always the same: great intellect, ability to accomplish much, but also this. He
deplored it. And yet, without it, he could not track them down."

"An android," he said, "doesn't care what happens to any other android. That's one of the
indications we look for."
"Then," Miss Luft said, "you must be an android."
That stopped him; he stared at her.
"Because," she continued, "Your job is to kill them, isn't it?"

"Maybe that's a false memory. Don't androids sometimes go around with false memories?"


"You androids," Rick said, "don't exactly cover for each other in times of stress."
 Garland snapped, "I think you're right; it would seem we lack a specific talent you humans
possess. I believe it's called empathy."

"Then at one time an authentic Garland existed," Phil Resch said. "And somewhere along the way
got replaced." His sharklike lean face twisted and he struggled to understand. "Or - I've been
impregnated with a false memory system. Maybe I only remember Garland over the whole time. But
- " His face, suffused now with growing torment, continued to twist and work spasmodically. "Only
androids show up with false memory systems; it's been found ineffective in humans."
