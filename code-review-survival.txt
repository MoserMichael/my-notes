Code review survival guide:

Me:

Before submitting your first PR
    - look for coding guidelines / conventions. What is the official style? Any declaration in written form?
    - while studying the codebase, look out for the following:
        - is code written in the same style?
        - study recent commits, is there a change in conventions or change in coding style?
    - ask if there are any expectation on the coding style
    - ask who will be reviewing the code, look at PR's by the same person

        
     
Before submitting any PR
    - if it is of significant size: 
        - give the reviewer an overview of the solution (this can reduce tensions during the review process)
    - High unit test coverage turns out to be a must: otherwise you didn't think enough about the edge cases (that's where a lot of problems are)

Politics
    - if you are several months into a job, and notice that code reviews are strictly one sided (from top to bottom)
        - or that an important team member never puts up his changes for review by you, then raise that question with the management! That's a legitimate concern, as code review practice is supposed to be knowledge sharing.

    How to do code review?

    Make a checklist like:
        - SOLID principles: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID
        - readability
        - security
        - Platform specific problems:
            in mobile apps: 
                will it work with low privilege?
                user leaves flow at any given moment
                connection loss
        - try to understand the whole solution before starting PR.
        - automate PR process
            - lint checks (for submitter)
        - how urgent is the change?
        - is there time left for optimization?
        - review should be a source of knowledge for requester:
            - mention other possibilities, explain your comments.
        - appreciate good solutions (reduces tension between submitter and reviewer)

    - Code review process
        - first pass through the PR
            - review unit test first: to fin out what the code is doing
            - loot at the code: does anything stick out (as begin not correct) ? (if yes: start in depth review, if not - approve the thing)
        - second oass through the PR
            - are the changes straightforward? (does not depend on size of PR)
            - focus on best practices
                - do the names make sense?
                - language features used appropriately? (is this idiomatic code?)
                    - ask questions if not (example: if Kotlin is written as if it were Java)
                - check if unit tests if they are doing what they say
                    - red flag: class under test is mocked.
            - ask questions about business logic if the requirements are not clear.       
            
            - look for code that he likes - and give positive feedback if found. (thumbs up)

        - in depth code review           
            - open the code in the IDE,
                - manually test the changes (go through unit tests) , go through unit test in debugger
                - set breakpoint in top level of the change, strep through the code of the change.

            - easy to follow code (calls in one direction) vs code that calls multiple directions (much more complicated case)
                - ask questions about interactions - if flow is complicated (he says 'spaghetti')

    - General
        - frame things as questions or suggestions
        - his policy
            - otherwise approve some seventy percent of the code.
            - not approve 20% of the code (leaves questions)
            - remaining 10% - block the code review with change requests.

    Code review is a social activity:
        - knowledge sharing
        - mechanism of improving the code base (did you consider this?)
        - his analogy: when working on a big code base all are like blind people, touching on an elephant - no one has the full picture, so they have to cooperate.x
    
    How to do the code review?
        - apply code of the PR,
        - review the tests code
            
    Healthy code review discussion:
        - "discuss questions that don't have a clear-cut answer, but concrete enough to be debated"
        - Design questions should not occur during code review!
        - nitpicks (stylistic question) - that's not healthy. Says these question should be cleared out a priori - and ideally delegated to a lint program

        - says what should be discussed:
            - naming 
            - how to test things / what additional tests should be there?
    
    Advise:
        - For big PR's: says it needs multiple diffs, where each diff can be viewed on it's own - the idea is that it should be easier to review the peaces.

          (1 - How is that possible? You need to write the whole pull request in git branch A - finish all the work, including tests. 
           2 - then create another git branch B, copy part of the files from branch A to branch B, each time copy logically related files, and make a commit that 'stands for itself'.
              /still, i think that's a terrible practice - to ask for that

               Still this supposes that the solution of a big PR can be broken up into strict layers.

Smartbear telling a very good story on code reviews, and how the thing can go wrong. [link](https://smartbear.com/blog/avoiding-the-politics-of-code-review/) Here is my summary:

Problems
- formalizing and mandating a corporate code review process can lead to a unintended consequences
- you also need to teach everyone to use the code review tool in an effective manner! That's not a trivial task

In practice:

- the code review policy can be used in a toxic manner by an individual within the company. (everything in a company has some department political aspect)
  Patterns of abuse:
  - The big man on the campus
    Individual uses code reviews as a way to cement his position of influence.
        - nitpicking on every detail
        - problem: the constant flow of negative feedback creates a situation of learned helplessness on the part of the individual under review.
        (this means that the individual doesn't even try anything, and falls into a state of passiveness, for fear of getting another bunch of hits)
        - problem for the organisation: the team does not scale well. The big man on the campus becomes a scare resource and bottleneck.
   - The cool kids: instead of one man there is a clique with elevated privileges
        - problem: leads to groupthink
        - "Admittance to the inner circle is hard-won and requires a lot of invested time and proved loyalty."
        - problem: "good ideas and practices are discarded if they come from the wrong people."
          initiative is limited to "the most long-tenured and thus the most insulated people on the team."
        - the cool kids also institute an informal "tournament ladder" - divide the team into in group, out group, and other groups in between.
          people are assigned to the group based on arbitrary detail.
            - people focus on the wrong thing, and not on moving the product further
            - it makes everyone neurotic, as it is hard for the individuals to play these games.
- The best part: how to avoid it:
    - "Ensure that reviews are two-way. Never have people who only review and people who only get reviewed."
    - "Always focus on the code and not the person who wrote the code."
    - "Make the reviews small, frequent, and informal. Marathon group sessions in rooms make people defensive."
    - "Frame things as questions and suggestions rather than orders and accusations. Ask that others do the same."
    - "Automate as many checks as possible so that reviews don't focus on simple details."
    - You can frame the review as optional "asking for advice" instead of a gatekeeper approach of "getting the code approved"
    - Says that the potential harm of the bad approach is worse than taking up the risks, that is taking the risks that come with the policy of not requiring a code review for each and every commit.
