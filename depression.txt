- very important how one is interpreting things (attributional or explanatory style)

- many risk factors for depression (having depressed parents is a strong factor - so I am doing damage to my kids!!!)

- many paths into depression, many paths out

- important: develop skills how to get out of depression. (medication does not train these - therefore high relapse ratio)
    - better explanatory style 
    - better interpersonal skills / come up with a support network
    - problem solving / decision making skills
    - HOW TO BUILD A COMPELLING FUTURE

- people who focus on the future 'how do I build my future' do better at getting out of depression !!!

- key risk factors:
    - internal orientation :: use themselves as reference point, use their feeling to interpret reality, indication on what to do. This drives you inwardly.
            Your feelings can easily deceive you. Ability to go outside of your own self - to compare things - is important.
            Goal: learn to 'reality test', this requires to 'go out of yourself' - to overcome 'cognitive rigidity'. 
            Otherwise you are a prisoner of your own thoughts.
     
            Cognitive flexibility is important: create multiple explanations on what is happening. (prevents your from overgeneralizing an driving yourself mad, believing your own explanation of things)
            Master the art of recognizing what you don't know

     - stress generation : how do people make decisions that make their depression worse? 

         How do moods influence decision making processes? Your mood influences what you remember and how you make choices.

         Learn how to take actions that are consistent with the goals rather than take actions that are consistent with the feelings !!!

         Stop drinking - alcohol is aggravating depression!!!

     - wrong: using the past a reference point to predict the future - that's a bad loop!
       Need to convert things into action

         "was never good, will never be good"

         IMPORTANT MESSAGE: YOU ARE MORE THAN YOUR HISTORY!!! DON'T USE IRRELEVANT STUFF TO DEFINE YOUR OWN SELF!

         CREATE POSSIBILITIES, THERE AREN'T ANY GUARANTEES FOR .. FOREVER.

         Getting out of the loop in your thoughts: use your thoughts to plan/create useful / positive, timely action - instead of moving in circles.

     - Global cognitive style: person engages in over-general thinking. 

         Example: have a bad day - life isn't fair (jumping from day to life)

         This prevents you from solving problems effectively, prevents you from learning skills - if you always tend to overgeneralize.

         Flow of steps: that's an exercise to go from "global" to "concrete" in their thinking.
            - delineate all the steps it needs to do a given task (like doing a shower)
         Next exercise : "do a flowchart for being happy". 
            - being specific is something that depressed persons have a hard time with.
     
     - our expectations are the filter for how we make judgements; now how do you know if your expectations are realistic?

         Unrealistic expectations are a source of unhappiness.
         
         First check: is that realistic? (??)
      
- When you need professional help?
    - suicidal thoughts (big indication)
    - feeling stuck, overwhelmed
    - don't have help by support network that can help with 'reality testing'

- Importance of getting help
    - you are blind for your own blind spots (that's the purpose of this talks)
    - need to do big decisions, depression affects quality of decisions
    - a depressed person is dragging down three other persons on average.
 
- Todo list: 
    
    - physical examinations (to exclude health factors that could make it worse)
    - Alcohol - complete stop
    - get enough sleep (number one common complaint!)
    - exercise!!! (quick gains)
    - do fun thing - you need to get out of the rut,
    - don't compare yourself to others / stay clear of social media.

    = learn about your psychological vulnerabilities (first step in coping with them)
    = learn to distinguish 
        = facts from feelings/beliefs from facts

And other stuff....

    Closure counts for lot - don't leave things unresolved, move on.
